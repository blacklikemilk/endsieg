The first is Pyotr Krasnov, an autonomist leader of the Don Cossacks and former commander in chief of the Kerensky Republican Provisional Government of 1917. Krasnov is ready to ally with Ukraine and the new independent states from the former Russian Empire to fight the Bolsheviks. His priority is to attack Tsaritsyn and connect with the Eastern Whites before attacking Moscow with them.\n\n The second option was supported by Anton Denikin, leader of the Russian Volunteers. Denikin refuses to give up control of the Russian Empire territories and is not ready to recognize and ally with Ukraine and other neighboring countries from the former Tsars' Empire. Denikin's priority is to free the Kuban and North- Caucasus from the Bolsheviks before attacking Moscow from the South through the Ukraine."

    industrialisation.1.t:0 "Traditionalists Argue Against Industrialisation"
    industrialisation.1.d:0 "Traditionalists in the government have argued against our move towards a industrial society arguing that we have lived for hundreds of years on an agrarian based economy and that there is no need to move towards an industrial society now. \n\n None-the-less the reform will be going through but the traditionalists will keep the government somewhat divided for the time being..."
    industrialisation.1.a:0 "Oh well"
    industrialisation.2.t:0 "Unrest Amongst the Workers"
    industrialisation.2.d:0 "With Industrialisation in our country moving forward ever so slowly it has not come without its troubles as many factory owners have started instead of searching for skilled workers, taken the unskilled workers for cheaper labor. Due to this there has been growing unrest in the new working class, whilst not quite serious yet the bubble will burst eventually..."
    industrialisation.2.a:0 "We are good for now!"
    industrialisation.3.t:0 "Pre-Industrial Society"
    industrialisation.3.d:0 "We are now considered by the world to be a Pre-Industrial Society and have effectively moved away from being the Agrarian Society we once were. Of course our path to this stage has not come without its troubles but the path ahead of us is still long and windy."
    industrialisation.3.a:0 "One Hurrah for Industrialisation!"
    industrialisation.4.t:0 "Railway Construction"
    industrialisation.4.d:0 "In order to increase the efficiency of goods being transported across the country our government has taken the initiative to start construction of a major railway, this alone should employ many workers however the costs will be quite high though worth it in the end if we plan to move further."
    industrialisation.4.a:0 "Start working!"
    industrialisation.5.t:0 "People's Mentality"
    industrialisation.5.d:0 "Despite our efforts to start industrialisation reforms many of our people still have a backwards mentality toward industrialisation. Many of our rich capitalists still prefer to invest in land rather than buisnesses, they see investments in industry risky making land purchases much more appealing."
    industrialisation.5.a:0 "This is a bad mentality for the long run!"
    industrialisation.6.t:0 "Early Industrial Society"
    industrialisation.6.d:0 "We are now considered by the world to be an Early Industrial Society, effectively moving away from our former status as a Pre-Industrial Society. Now we can be considered to be  more like some of the European nations that have progressed somewhat significantly in terms of industry."
    industrialisation.6.a:0 "Two Hurrahs for Industrialisation!"
    industrialisation.7.t:0 "Major Workers Strike"
    industrialisation.7.d:0 "Issues from the past with unskilled workers being employed for cheap wages over the skilled have not been forgotten. A major workers strike has been held in one of our major industrial areas where workers have been protesting for higher wages and less work hours which have put a strain on our production output, if this isn't resolved quick it will turn into a problem."
    industrialisation.7.a:0 "Give them what they want..."
    industrialisation.8.t:0 "Protests from Traditionalists"
    industrialisation.8.d:0 "As we start to move forward even further the traditionalists have not gone away by any means, there is still a large struggle not only with some backwards politcians but the people themselves that have the same tradtionalist mentaility refusing change!"
    industrialisation.8.a:0 "Darn"
    industrialisation.9.t:0 "Population Through the Years"
    industrialisation.9.d:0 "Due to the fact that our nation does not have enough land suited for farming required to feed our growing population is making things quite difficult, many say that if we continue going forward we will have to continually rely on other nations for food products."
    industrialisation.9.a:0 "They have a point..."
    industrialisation.10.t:0 "Basic Industrial Society"
    industrialisation.10.d:0 "We are now considered by the world to be a Basic Industrial Society, like most European nations, we are just below the major countries."
    industrialisation.10.a:0 "Three Hurrahs for Industrialisation!"
    industrialisation.11.t:0 "Workers Strike Spirals Out of Control!"
    industrialisation.11.d:0 "Workers in our most industrialised region have started a strike for higher wages, less work hours, better working conditions, and universal suffrage. Whilst the strike started off small it quickly grew in size to thousands of people protesting, the local government in turn sent out an army unit to keep control of the protest where it quickly turned into a blood bath as shots were fired onto the crowd."
    industrialisation.11.a:0 "Not good..."
    industrialisation.12.t:0 "Resources Issue"
    industrialisation.12.d:0 "As we push even further in terms of industrialisation it is getting rather difficult as much of the resources required do not currently have or produce enough of which means our progress will be significantly slowed down for now."
    industrialisation.12.a:0 "Darn"
    industrialisation.13.t:0 "New Rising Social Class"
    industrialisation.13.d:0 "With our industrial growth promoting large immigration towards our cities/industrial centers we have found ourselves unequipped to handle this large urban population growth where not enough residences can be constructed in time to house enough people. Many are forced to live together in horrible conditions and then go to work in such conditions giving birth to a new social class that may be very well susceptible to revolutionary ideas...."
    industrialisation.13.a:0 "Frightening"
    industrialisation.14.t:0 "Industrial Society"
    industrialisation.14.d:0 "We have reached the top of the ladder and are now considered to officialy be an Industrial Society, we are now largely ahead of most countries in the world."
    industrialisation.14.a:0 "Four Hurrahs for Industrialisation!"

    ww1_britain.1.t:0 "Anti-German Sentiment"
    ww1_britain.1.d:0 "Ever since the death of Queen Victoria and Kaiser Wilhelm II's imperialistic and naval ambitions which threaten our nation there has been a great schism between Germany and the United Kingdom."
    ww1_britain.1.a:0 "Those Huns won't get ahead of us!"
    ww1_britain.2.t:0 "Preparation for War"
    ww1_britain.2.d:0 "The fuse leading to the Powder Keg has been lit, it is only a matter of time before the war breaks out for which we must prepare for the better or the worst of what it may turn into."
    ww1_britain.2.a:0 "Alright"
    ww1_britain.3.t:0 "British Neutrality"
    ww1_britain.3.d:0 "Although we have heavily aligned ourselves with the Entente we have declared neutrality in this conflict for the time being, whilst it doesnt mean we will remain neutral for the whole of the war, we will for now keep a watchful eye on how the war goes and may enter later."
    ww1_britain.3.a:0 "We will keep a safe distance for now..."
    ww1_britain.4.t:0 "Backing of France!"
    ww1_britain.4.d:0 "With the Germans violating Beglian Neutrality and going against any sort of British Interests we have taken neccesary steps to join the Entente in the war against them."
    ww1_britain.4.a:0 "We won't let our allies down!"
    ww1_britain.5.t:0 "Britain Declares War on Central Powers"
    ww1_britain.5.d:0 "Whilst we have previously proclaimed temporary neutrality, we have spectated the war and have now taken actions to get involved ourselves on the side of the Entente whom ultimately protects British interests."
    ww1_britain.5.a:0 "We will not accept German hegemony over Europe!"
    ww1_britain.6.t:0 "North Sea Blockade"
    ww1_britain.6.d:0 "In an effort to restrict the maritime supply of goods to the Central Powers, we have taken actions to blockade any convoys heading to Germany or any other Central Powers members. The German Empire heaily relies on imports to feed their population and supply their war industry, thus this should have a serious affect on their internal stability and war efficiency."
    ww1_britain.6.a:0 "Good"
    ww1_britain.7.t:0 "Conscription in Ireland Begins"
    ww1_britain.7.d:0 "Whilst our attempts to conscript the Irish populous have been met with serious protest and we have been on shakey terms following the Easter Rising, it is none the less neccesary as we are in dire need of more manpower to fill the ranks."
    ww1_britain.7.a:0 "A neccesary action"
    ww1_britain.8.t:0 "Irish Conscription Crisis"
    ww1_britain.8.d:0 "Calls for conscription in Ireland have been met with serious protest and opposition and thus we have decided to not go through with instating conscription in Ireland. Whilst it may deprive us of neccesary manpower it will be none-the-less more worthwhile and keep the nation more stable in a time where stability is neccesary to avoid revolution."
    ww1_britain.8.a:0 "Dissent is the last thing we need"
    ww1_britain.9.t:0 "Call for Scandinavia to Break with Germany"
    ww1_britain.9.d:0 "Like the United States has decided to break with Germany we have asked the Scandinavian monarchs, Haakon VII of Norway, Gustav V of Sweden, and Christian X of Denmark, to consider breaking with Germany. Whilst the North Sea Blockade is effective, it will never be 100% efficient if the Scandinavian nations continue to trade with Germany."
    ww1_britain.9.a:0 "Hopefully they will follow Americas lead"
    ww1_britain.901.t:0 "Scandinavia Refuses to Break with Germany"
    ww1_britain.901.d:0 "The Scandinavian monarchs have recently held a conference in Copenhagen and have ultimately declined to break off diplomatic and trade relations with Germany because of the 'ruthless' submarine warfare."
    ww1_britain.901.a:0 "Damn!"
    ww1_britain.902.t:0 "Scandinavia Agrees to Break with Germany"
    ww1_britain.902.d:0 "The Scandinavian monarchs have recently held a conference in COpenhagen and have ultimately agreed to break off diplomatic and trade relations with Germany because of the ruthless submarine warfare."
    ww1_britain.902.a:0 "Great"
    ww1_britain.10.t:0 "Our Friends Portugal"
    ww1_britain.10.d:0 "The Portuguese have long since remained close with us, it is well known that the Portuguese and Germany are not on good terms with some serious tension between the two when it comes to submarine warfare."
    ww1_britain.10.a:0 "Ok"
    ww1_britain.11.t:0 "Portugal Joins Entente"
    ww1_britain.11.d:0 "With the Portuguese and Germany facing serious tension due to Germany's decision to enact unrestricted submarine warfare, which has as a result sank many Portuguese ships, the Portuguese have ultimately decided to join the Entente."
    ww1_britain.11.a:0 "Great"
    ww1_britain.12.t:0 "Negotiations with Bulgaria"
    ww1_britain.12.d:0 "Bulgaria is key to success in the Balkans, should the Central Powers get Bulgaria to join them our ally Serbia will likely fall and thus Germany will be able to directly send supplies to Turkey. However, should Bulgaria join us Turkey's capital Constantinople will be severely threatened and Serbia's position furthermore reinforced. The thing is, we have unlike the Central Powers, little to offer to Bulgaria. However, we have urged Serbia to cede some of its territory to Bulgaria in hopes of getting Bulgaria to join us. However, it is not as much as the Central Powers are offering, the Bulgarians will likely not consider our offer but there is still a chance they will."
    ww1_britain.12.a:0 "Lets hope they will consider it"
    ww1_britain.1201.t:0 "Britain Offers us Deal"
    ww1_britain.1201.d:0 "The British have attempted to sway us to their side, they have offered some of our claims in Serbia and Edirne from the Ottoman Turks. Although it isn't as much as the Central Powers are willing to offer, would it be likely that Germany will win this war given their inability to control the seas?"
    ww1_britain.1201.a:0 "Accept British Deal"
    ww1_britain.1201.b:0 "We are not interested"
    ww1_britain.1202.t:0 "Bulgaria Accepts Our Offer"
    ww1_britain.1202.d:0 "The Bulgarians have thankfully accepted our generous offer of territorial gains, although it isn't as much as what the Central Powers were likely offering it seems they have come to their senses that we will ultimately win this war in the end."
    ww1_britain.1202.a:0 "Great!"
    ww1_britain.1203.t:0 "Bulgaria Rejects Our Offer"
    ww1_britain.1203.d:0 "As we have predicted, the Bulgarians have unfortunately rejected our offer of territorial gains, it is very much likely due to the fact that the Central Powers have promised far more than we could offer. As unfortunate as it is that we could not sway Bulgaria to our side we will ultimately win this war, with them or not."
    ww1_britain.1203.a:0 "Quite unfortunate indeed"
    ww1_britain.13.t:0 "Bulgaria Joins Entente"
    ww1_britain.13.d:0 "The Bulgarians have finally finished preparing to join the conflict and have officially declared their entrance into the Entente. With their help we will keep Turkey and Germany divided and threaten Constantinople as well as reinforcing Serbia's position for good."
    ww1_britain.13.a:0 "Great!"
    ww1_britain.14.t:0 "Our Friends America"
    ww1_britain.14.d:0 "Whilst the United States has declared neutrality in the European conflict they ultimately favor us far more than the Central Powers given our democratic status."
    ww1_britain.14.a:0 "Hopefully we can get them to join"
    ww1_britain.15.t:0 "USA Joins Entente"
    ww1_britain.15.d:0 "The United States has long since been aiding the Entente throughout the war and it ultimately any sort of neutrality they have declared has withered away over time and they have ultimately decided to join the European conflict formally."
    ww1_britain.15.a:0 "The tide has turned"
    ww1_britain.16.t:0 "Fortification of the Suez Canal"
    ww1_britain.16.d:0 "The Suez Canal is a critical strategic point, and thus we have taken neccesary actions to fortify the canal in case of a future war."
    ww1_britain.16.a:0 "It is of strategic importance"
    ww1_britain.17.t:0 "Securing Southern Persia"
    ww1_britain.17.d:0 "Given Turkey's likely entrance on the side of the Central Powers we have taken actions to secure the South Persian oilfields and the route to India."
    ww1_britain.17.a:0 "Good"
    ww1_britain.18.t:0 "Turkish Ships Incorporated into Royal Navy"
    ww1_britain.18.d:0 "The Turkish Ships 'Osmân-ı Evvel' and 'Reşadiye' have been incporated into the Royal Navy on the orders of Winston Churchill who does not want to risk the ships being used against us. However, given the fact that the pay for the ships was funded by public subscriptions partially, by taverns, cafes, schools, and market, this action has caused considerable ill will in the Ottoman Empire. The seizure of the ships has influenced the Ottoman public opinion of us in a seriously negative way."
    ww1_britain.18.a:0 "Damn"
    ww1_britain.19.t:0 "Arab Revolt"
    ww1_britain.19.d:0 "Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca, has initiated the Arab Rebellion with the aim of securing independence from the ruling Ottoman Turks in hopes of creating a single unified Arab State. The Sharif claims that the Young Turks have violated the sacred tenets of Islam and has called upon Arab Muslims to the sacred Rebellion against the ostensibly 'impious' Ottoman Government. \n\n Whilst the revolt is being assisted by our government it is none-the-less not as popular as we could have hoped it would become with the majority of Arabs still staying loyal to the Ottoman Empire."

    ww1_britain.25.d:0 "A daring plan has been proposed by the British Admiralty to land troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula and from there to head up and to hopefully eventually seize the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople which means a great deal to the Turks. Should we take it we would likely force them out of the war."

The plan involves landing a substantial force, either of British or Russian soldiers, or both, on the flat beaches of Pomerania on the North German Coast which happens to be a bit less than 100 miles from Berlin. \n\n However, of course such a plan would require a huge specialist fleet with submarines and extensive mining to keep the landing force safe from the German Navy. It could be done but will it be ultiamtely worth it?"

May circles on the edge of the fight until he sights Richtofen's cousin Wolfram crossing his front, Richtofen sees his cousin under fire and closes in, opens fire. The inexperienced May, falls out of control probably saving his life. Richtofen breaks his own rule and follows him down as May plunges earthward but he regains control just over the Somme and follows the river West - and to the safety of his own lines. May's friend Roy Brown sees the pursuit and dives to help, a low level chase follows. With a strong easterly win, Richtofen is pushed further and further over enemy lines... alone... and under constant ground fire. Richtofen seems to become target fixated, unaware of Brown diving behind him; at this exact time Cedric Popkin, of the 24th Australian Machine Gun Company fires at the Red Triplane along with soldiers from the 53rd Battery, Royal Australian Artillery. As Brown fires a burst the Triplane rears up to the right, at 1200 hours near Vaux-sur-Somme, Richtofen receives a single, fatal, bullet wound to the chest. The Red Triplane Fokker falls vertically but pulls up at the last moment, most likely still under the control of Richtofen, but by the time the aircraft stops... Richtofen is dead. To this day nobody who knows who killed the Red Baron as the Sopwith and the ground fire both used the Vickers .303. However May, Mellersh, and LeBoutillier all claim to have seen the Triplane rear up as Roy Brown fired, though the shot that enetered the under right of his armpit exiting under his left nipple gave high credence to groundfire bringing him down."

The coup had been sanctioned and agreed upon by the German Empire itself which was dissatisfied by the inefficiency of the Republican government to deliver the promised and much needed grain supplies to the starving German Army. Skoropadsky that same day was Christ mated by the church and became the Hetman of Ukraine. Many Ukrainian nationalists accused Skoropadsky of being a German collaborator who was supported by wealthy landowners. He was considered too Pro-Russian and dictatorial.

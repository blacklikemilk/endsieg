 OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_NAME:0 "Operation Barbarossa"
 OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_DESC:0 "With the start of Operation Barbarossa on the 22nd of June 1941, Germany has officialy broken the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The first phase was the first and only attack along the entire frontline, and captured a huge stroke of USSR territories. The German army seems unstoppable and the Luftwaffe reportedly destroyed 4,000 Soviet Aircraft while only losing 80 of their own. Libya is still holding strong and so far the Soviets seem unable to resist the German Panzers. Japan stands poised to attack the allies in the Pacific... "

 TURNING_TIDE_NAME:0 "The Turning Tide"
 TURNING_TIDE_DESC:0 "The tide has finally turned for the Axis, Germany has been beaten out of Stalingrad and North Africa with the Battle of Kursk now being the battle that will make or break the future of German offensive military operations, Sicily has been taken by the allies and Italy is threatening to switch sides, in the Pacific the Japanese Empire has finally reached its zenith and is starting to regress."
 ENG_TURNING_TIDE_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom's finest hour has long passed and it is no longer alone in this conflict, the Germans have been decisively defeated along with their Italian allies in North Africa and Sicily has now been invaded pushing Italy off its balance."
 FRA_TURNING_TIDE_DESC:0 "Mainland France has been conquered by the enemy which has held on to it for three years now but the French have not given up, resistance continues elsewhere in the colonies where there are plans for coming back and pushing out the enemies which have occupied France."
 GER_TURNING_TIDE_DESC:0 "With Stalingrad being a disaster and us being pushed out of the Caucuses all hope is lost for gaining control of the Soviet Union's vast oil resources, our luck is no better in Africa where we have been decisvely beaten and now Italy has been invaded and may very likely switch sides if we do not keep them in the Axis by force. However all is not lost, we have been planning a major operation under the codname Citadel which plans to cut off the Kursk Salient, if we manage to beat the Soviets here and push them back we will be back on track."
 ITA_TURNING_TIDE_DESC:0 "The past year has been a disaster for Italy, not only have we been pushed out of North Africa and our other colonies but the Allies have just recently invaded Sicily and are now threatening to invade the mainland country with bombing raids already causing panic and discontent with the war. It may be time to switch sides and get rid of the Duce..."
 JAP_TURNING_TIDE_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan has been so far largely undefeated in its efforts to expand, but it has finally reached its Zenith and has started to regress in power and influence with the onslaught of the United States in the Pacific, we need to regroup ourselves and push towards victory or forever live with the consequences of defeat..."
 SOV_TURNING_TIDE_DESC:0 "The Great Patriotic War has raged on for two years now, we have lost a great deal of lives in this conflict to keep the motherland safe from the fascist beast invaders but it was not in vain, the Germans have been badly beaten on all fronts, with Stalingrad and the Caucasus secured we must focus on defending the Kursk Salient after getting information from the British that there will be an attack specifically centered on that area. We must also lift the Leningrad siege which has lasted two years now costing almost two million lives, as they say it takes more courage to retreat than advance in the Red Army."
 USA_TURNING_TIDE_DESC:0 "The United States has been unwillingly pushed into this global conflict following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese have proven a capable enemy but we are not a perfect match, the industrial might of the United States shall crush the Japanese Empire's power in the Pacific and once we are done with them the Japanese language will be spoken only in hell."
 OTHER_TURNING_TIDE_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, will be affected by this conflict that spans across several continents around the world."
 KAMPF_DEM_VATERLAND_NAME:0 "Kampf Für Das Vaterland"
 KAMPF_DEM_VATERLAND_DESC:0 "The German Reich is being pushed back heavily from all directions, the Allies in the West took back all of France, Belgium, and are now dangerously close to breaking through and infiltrating the heart of the Reich itself, in the east the Russians are still quite a ways behind the Oder River but the front has extended greately and our allies Romania has surrendered with Hungary dangerously close. Italy is at a standstill and in Asia the situation for Japan is not getiing any better."
 ENG_KAMPF_DEM_VATERLAND_DESC:0 "The Allies have over a period of a few months pushed the Germans back compeltely from France and Belgium, in Italy they have advanced fairly north and the United Kingdom has recently taken Greece from the Germans, let us gather our forces and crush the beast once and for all."
 FRF_KAMPF_DEM_VATERLAND_DESC:0 "France for the last five years has been under occupation of the German Reich, however with Operation Overlord a success France has been liberated, but will it fall victim to Hitler's last gamble?"
 GER_KAMPF_DEM_VATERLAND_DESC:0 "The Reich has lost its holdings in France and Belgium and is now getting pushed back into its own territory while Hitler rolls the dice for what will be Germany's last major offensive and major gamble. In the east the Soviets have taken Bulgaria and Romania and turned them against the Reich as well as extending the Front as south as Croatia, though they are still behind the Oder river the Reich will not last under this pressure forever."

 JAP_KAMPF_DEM_VATERLAND_DESC:0 "The Japanese peoples have fought bravely for the past four years in the pacific theatre however the awoken giant, America has been getting closer and closer. In Burma Japan is getting pushed back by the British whilst the Chinese are finally getting the Upper Hand and thinning the Japanese lines, but the war is far from over the people will not surrender until total annihilation of Japan."
 SOV_KAMPF_DEM_VATERLAND_DESC:0 "The Fascist beast has pushed us back as far as Moscow four years ago but here we are four years later pushing them back to Berlin. We will continue this struggle until we reach Berlin itself and we shall show no mercy!"
 USA_KAMPF_DEM_VATERLAND_DESC:0 "Japan has been rid from the list of the worlds greatest naval powers and now it is all but island hopping to Tokyo to claim the final victory, on the western front the United States and her allies have taken back France and Beglium and pushed further north into Italy. It is clear that the war has been lost for the enemy, but it is far from over."

 GOTTERDAMMERUNG_NAME:0 "Götterdämmerung"
 GOTTERDAMMERUNG_DESC:0 "The German Eastern Front is on the brink of collapse. The Allies are quickly advancing through France after D-Day and almost half of Italy is in their hands. And while the German Reich is falling, their Japanese Allies are increasingly under pressure from the American giant which is ever so slowly creeping toward mainland Japan."
 ENG_GOTTERDAMMERUNG_DESC:0 "The British Empire has not seen any battles in Europe following their retreat from Dunkerque, but now five years later we have landed in Normandy with our Allies and our airforce is now easily taking control of the German skies. Will we succeed to force Germany to surrender, or will our costly invasion of Normandy fail and force us to seek peace? In addition to Normandy we also hold most of Southern Italy with the capital Rome."
 FRF_GOTTERDAMMERUNG_DESC:0 "After capitulating in 1940 to the German government the French nation had been all but a government in exile, however now our allies have gained a foothold in Normandy, perhaps we may be liberated."
 GER_GOTTERDAMMERUNG_DESC:0 "After roughly five years of warfare the Reich has been driven back on all fronts along with its allies. In June of 1944 the allies have gained a foothold in Normandy, the allies have a foothold in Italy, and even worse the Soviet menace is outnumbering us 10 to 1 in some areas and driving ever so slowly towards Berlin. Our Airforce and Navy are  nothing like it had been in the past, our industry slowing disentegrating due to allied air raids. Will you be able to save the reich?"
 JAP_GOTTERDAMMERUNG_DESC:0 "Our war against the United States has led to a least favorable situation, however the Japanese Empire is far from dead still holding many resources. However due to heavy allied commerce raiding and naval supremacy our supplies is extremely low and industry is far from booming. All that we can do now is fight to the death and that is what we shall do."
 ITA_GOTTERDAMMERUNG_DESC:0 "Following the Allied invasion of Sicily the previous summer which had let the allies invade the rest of Italy, Mussolini had been ousted by his own peoples and forced to create a government in-exile only recognized by Germany and Japan, the Italian Social Republic. However the war is far from over and our losses can be reversed."
 SOV_GOTTERDAMMERUNG_DESC:0 "The Fascist invaders have greately underestimated the strength of the Russian peoples united with the will to defend their motherland, after three diastrous years of fighting the German Reich and her allies have been heavily pushed back on the eastern front, defeat after defeat. Now we must launch Operation Bagration to crush the beast once and for all and liberate Belarus."
 USA_GOTTERDAMMERUNG_DESC:0 "Following the attack on Pearl Harbor the United States officially entered the War, by 1944 the United States and her allies landed in Normandy and control Southern Italy. In the pacific the United States strategy of Island Hopping has been bringing them ever so closer to the Japanese mainland, but we are still far off."
 OTHER_GOTTERDAMMERUNG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, will be affected by this conflict that spans across several continents around the world."
 ENDSIEG_NAME:0 "Endsieg"
 ENDSIEG_DESC:0 "Aided by air blows which paralyzed communications throughout the length and breadth of Germany, the Allied Armies have surged across the Cologne Plain. Powerful elements of the Red Army consolidated bridgeheads have regrouped along the Oder while significant advances were made by forces on the flanks. What is left of the once mighty German Army is now the very old and young who are left to defend what remains, meanhwhile in Berlin, Hitler has already entered his bunker."
 ENG_ENDSIEG_DESC:0 "With Germany being defeated in all but name the United Kingdom continues its intense bombing raids on the remaining German industry as the allies enroach on the remenants of German resistance."
 FRF_ENDSIEG_DESC:0 "Germany is no more, although it is defated in all but name the German Army is still putting up fierce resistance but it is only a matter of time before we break through past the Rhine and force a surrender on Germany."
 GER_ENDSIEG_DESC:0 "Germany is on its knees, its enemies have infiltrated the German homeland itself and are contuing the advance, kids as young as ten and men as old as seventy have joined the Volkssturm to defend the Reich at all costs. The Fuhrer is confident the war can still be won with Goebbels still relaying that Endsieg is near, how far this is from the truth we do not know but the fight shall go on!"
 KIT_ENDSIEG_DESC:0 ""
 JAP_ENDSIEG_DESC:0 "The Japanese Empire has been slashes on the heel, we no longer have enough naval power to defend against the United States even remotely, in Iwo Jima the United States has concentrated a portion of its navy to bombard the area in an attempt to capture it, we must not let it fall at all costs! To surrender is a great dishonor and for that we must fight to the bloody end even if it means the nation of Japan will be blown off the face of the earth!"
 SOV_ENDSIEG_DESC:0 "The Great Patriotic war is coming to a close with the Germans behind the Vistula and the Red Army coming ever so closer to Berlin the very heart of the beast itself, but with the Great Patriotic War coming to a close a new line is being drawn in the middle of europe between us and the Allies with our different ideologies."
 USA_ENDSIEG_DESC:0 "The United States has successfully driven back the Japanese who are now not even one third of what they used to be, it is only a matter of time before the whole of Japan comes crashing down, our invasion of the Phillipines is so far a success and Iwo Jima is looking to be won over soon as well. The next target is perhaps the Japanese mainland itself..."
 OTHER_ENDSIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, will be affected by this conflict that spans across several continents around the world."
 THE_GREAT_WAR_NAME:0 "The Great War"
 THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "For the first time in one hundred years in europe a conflict is brewing which will take more lives than any other time in history and last an unusually long time. For the first time in history man and machine will be combined inventing dozens of new methods to kill and destroy, this is the Great War."
 GE1_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The German Empire was created at Versailles in 1871 with blood and iron after the defeat of France a year previously. But following the rise of Wilhelm II whom sacked Bismarck and his attempts at status quo Germany soon found itself with potential enemies on two fronts. These facts could not have been far from the German military’s mind as 1914 came: as Chief of Staff von Moltke put it - "war is inevitable, and the sooner the better". Time is running out. Can the 'place in the sun' and Germany's dominance in the world still be achieved?"
 AUH_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The Dual Monarchy had been created in 1867 from a compromise between Emperor Franz Josef and the nobility of Hungary. A patchwork empire, it was composed of eleven major ethnic groups. the empire centred around the capital, Vienna, and held together to a great degree by the strength of Emperor Franz Josef’s character. To limit Russian influence in the Balkans, Austria-Hungary aligned itself with Germany in 1879, and then with Italy in 1882 to form the Triple Alliance. However, with Germany the dominant party in the alliance, Austria-Hungary would find its foreign policy wishes subordinated to the desires of its senior partner. The rulers of Austria-Hungary."
 TUR_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "By the 18th century the Ottoman Empire was shrinking with its power eroded by a loss of internal authority and the expansionist ambitions of the European powers. The 19th century and early 20th century saw attempts at reform, including the creation of an executive branch, and a centralised government. But also witnessed the Ottoman Empire's substantial territorial decline. Meanwhile, the Turkish government was largely unable to collect its own taxes and the empire's communications and infrastructure remained primative, causing many to refer to Turkey as the "sick man of Europe". Can the Ottoman Empire modernise and survive or will it pass into the bygone era to where many argue it belongs?"
 RUS_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Russia's eyes have fallen on the Balkans and Constantinople, which controls the vital sea route to the outside world. To support this ambition, Russia has the largest army in the world and a rapidly modernising industrial base. However, for all its strength Russia suffers from dangerous weaknesses and severe unrest amongst the populous. Some members of the Tsar's council advise that a "short, victorious war" might rally the people and distract them from their woes. But if the war went badly for Russia, could the Tsar's rule survive the consequences?"
 EN1_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "At the turn of the century, all appeared well for the British Empire - covering two-fifths of the world's land surface, accounting for a quarter of the world's population, policed by the most professional army in the world and guarded by the mightiest fleet ever built. But beneath the assurances of imperial grandeur lay insecurity about the future: economically and industrially, the United States was outperforming the British and the Germans had commenced an ominous fleet building program to challenge the Royal Navy's dominance of the seas."
 FR3_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Once the greatest Power of Europe, France is now a troubled country. Economically, she has been overtaken by many of her rivals. A declining birthrate seems to promise further decline, and in an age of mass armies might prove a fatal weakness. Politically, the Third Republic is unstable. On the international scene, the defeat by Prussia in 1871 and Germany's occupation of the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine is a festering sore, and demands for 'revanche' - revenge - against Germany remain strong."
 US1_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Since gaining independence from Great Britain in 1783 the United States and its people have mostly concerned themselves with their own continent, and to a lesser extent Central and South America, following the declaration of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823. Following the defeat of Spain in the Spanish-American War the United States has emerged as a world power, but with its very small army, is still not considered a 'Great Power' in the European sense, although it has vast potential to do so. This potential comes from the population and vast economy that in is greater than Britain, France, Russia and Germany combined."

 BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_NAME:0 "The Balkan Powder Keg"
 BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "Although constantly arguing over some new crises since the Vienna Conference a major European war has been avoided on the European continent for almost a hundred years. But increasingly so in the past few decades tensions have been increasingly rising in the Balkans with various empires seekning to secure their dominance in the region. It will only takes one small spark to blow the Balkan Powder keg."

 KAISERSCHLACHT_NAME:0 "Kaiserschlacht"
 KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "For four years now a brutal stalemate has remained on the Western Front but in the east there is no longer a front with the collapse of the Russian Empire and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. It has allowed hundreds of thousands of German Soldiers to transfer to the west culminating in a plan for one final great offensive never before seen, the Kaiserschlacht. Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria however are in a very weak state and if a significant victory in the west does not happen it is very likely that not only will Germany collapse but the whole alliance."
 GE1_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "For four years now a military stalemate has lasted on the Western Front but with the surrender of the Russian Empire, Germany can use those divisions for a momentary numerical superiority over the allied forces on the Western Front. It is critical that we break through the front lines and force an armistice on France whilst the Americans are still in small numbers, once they come here we will stand no chance. The supply situation is getting worse every day and manpower is trickling away like sand through fingers. We have to put all of our effort together to make this one last push or suffer the consequences of capitulation."
 AUH_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The Austro-Hungarian Empire throughout the war has been a disaster but the October 1917 Battle of Caporetto has been a major victory for the Empire and the soon after collapse of the Russian Empire and Treaty of Brest-Litovsk  has relieved our forces in the east to focus on Italy and the Balkans. Though the Empire is still struggling to keep itself together with major war exhaustion and a large anti-war sentiment amongst the people. This will by no means be an task in either winning the war or keeping the empire intact, or both..."
 TUR_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The Allies thought that Turkey would be a pushover, but the war in the Middle East went its own wild way. A struggling empire that is seriously behind in almost every term compared to the west, the Ottoman Empire has managed to hold on four long years of fighting however the tide has turned and the British have taken Jerusalem the holy city, along with Baghdad and is now advancing from both Mesopotamian and Jordan-Israeli fronts towards Damascus and Mosul. If they are to fall so will we, however with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk signed, our forces in the caucasus are finally free for other use."
 SOV_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "Over the course of the Great War the weak Russian Empire grew heavily unstable and many lives were lost to which the soldiers and working class alike lost any trust and patriotism towards the Imperial Government and has formed its own Communist Government led by Vladimir Lenin. The disastrous Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed but we had no choice, and now in the midst of all this there is still a larger conflict ahead of us, the Russian Civil War."
 EN1_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom has fought in the fields of Flanders, the plains of Africa, and in the desert of the Middle East. Tremendous amounts of life has been lost over the course of the war and a victory does not seem any closer at times, but with the naval blockade against Germany, our enemy is severely weakened with mass starvation of civilians and military alike as well a heavy decline in morale and war effort. Whilst we are no better with our own war effort as it loses popularity by the day the Americans will soon arrive and provide fresh troops and a industrial superiority over the Central Powers, but we must survive the onslaught of the Ludendorff Offensive first."
 FR3_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The French people desperately outnumbered and outgunned by the Germans have fought on for four years with assistance of the British but the front has barely moved in those four years with a tremendous amount of life that has been lost with it. The Germans however have not managed to break through, not in Verdun, and not on the Belgian Front, however with their troops relieved from Russia they will gain numerical superiority against us, on the flip side the Americans will soon come and relieve us with fresh troops so we must hang on."
 US1_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The United States has largely remained neutral throughout the Great War but with the sinking of the Lusitania, Zimmerman Telegram, and the Black Tom sabotage as well as the loans we have given to the Allied Powers for which we must see repaid, we have been forced to enter the Great War or else face a grave loss of money if the Allied Forces fall. But whilst we have joined the war the year before, the transfer of troops has taken a lot longer than expected and we will only start arriving in Europe in large numbers in the following months."
 OTHER_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, will be affected by this conflict that spans across several continents around the world."

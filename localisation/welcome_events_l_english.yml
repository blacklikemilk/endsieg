    whalecum.3.d:0 "Welcome my friend, how is your day going! You have chosen the 1918 scenario, the war has now gone on for four long years, but not all is bad for the Central Powers whom have knocked out Russia, this means they can focus all of their eastern divisions on the western front giving them numerical superiority. This has prompted Erich Ludendorff to plan the 'Kaiserschlacht' otherwise known as the Kaiser's Battle or Spring Offensive. But on the inside the Central Powers are slowly falling apart, desertion, war exhaustion, and the blockade is all taking its toll and they will either win quick or lose quick. \n\n If you find any bugs make sure to report them in the bugs discussion, thanks in advance helps everyone out. \n\n Credits: Lev Slav and MisterJay"

    whalecum.4.d:0 "Welcome my friend, how is your day going! You have chosen the 1943 scenario, currently Germany has gathered its forces for its (historically) last major offensive on the eastern front at the Kursk Salient, however the Soviets who have learned of this Operation (Citadel) in advance have made efforts to entrench themselves heavily. In Italy, the allies have landed taking most of sicily and the Italians are on the fence between the Allies and the Axis. Japan has reached its zenith in Asia with the U.S starting to push down hard against them, however they are relatively successful in China. \n\n If you find any bugs make sure to report them in the bugs discussion, thanks in advance helps everyone out. \n\n Credits: Lev Slav and MisterJay"

In the west the allies have landed in Normandy bringing in more troops by the day, in the east the Soviets have launched Operation Bagration pushing hard against the Germans in Belarus. In Asia Japan is falling back with the U.S making signficant success island hopping towards the Japanese mainland and liberating allied territory with Japan still having a strong hold on China. Indeed this is the fate of the gods (Götterdämmerung). \n\n If you find any bugs make sure to report them in the bugs discussion, thanks in advance, helps everyone. \n\n Credits: Lev Slav and MisterJay"

    whalecum.6.d:0 "Welcome my friend, how is your day going! You have chosen the December 16, 1944 scenario, on the Western Front German troops under the cover of a fog (which is thankfully put the Allied Airforce out of action) have started their one last gamble starting a major (surprise) counter offensive with hopes to cut off the Allies by taking Antwerp and destroying four of the allied Armies. In the east the Red Army has just barely entered Germany already liberating (puppeting0 Romania, Bulgaria, and a chunk of Yugoslavia pushing into Hungary, the time has now home, the final fight for the Fatherland. Is it to late for Germany? In Asia the Americans have just recently landed in the Phillipines and the Japanese navy has been practically wiped out with a few remenants remaining, the hold on china is still strong. \n\n If you find anay bugs make sure to report them in the bugs discussion, thanks in advance, helps everyone. \n\n Credits: Lev Slav and MisterJay"

    whalecum.7.d:0 "Welcome my friend, how is your day going! You have daringly (if you play as Germany, what are you going to play the Soviet Union? Seriously if you do...just why?) chosen the 1945 scenario. On both fronts the Germans have been heavily pushed back but Goebbels calls for the Endsieg continue and the Fuhrer none-the-less continues to be filled with hope for a chance at turning the war around. In Asia, the Americans are now fighting a winning battle at Iwo Jima, right next to mainland Japan, which has now been bombed to bits. \n\n If you find any bugs make sure to report it in the bugs discussion so I can fix it, thanks in advance. \n\n Credits: Lev Slav and MisterJay"

    whalecum.8.t:0 "Welcome to the Mod (1948)"
    whalecum.8.d:0 "Welcome my friend, how is your day going! You have chosen the 1948, alternate history scenario where Germany has to an extent won the Second World War. Following the decisive German victory at Moscow and then Stalingrad, Germany and the Soviet Union reluctantly agreed to a treaty. In Ialy the Allies pushed for a major invasion prompting the Italian King, Vittorio Emanuel to switch sides with the Allies initial success, as a result the Germans quickly beat back the Italian troops occupying Montenegro, Albania, and Greece setting up their own client states before setting up a loyal Italian Social Republic headed by Benito Mussolini and defeating the allied invasion. With no side able to break the dead lock in the next years an armistice, with no treaty, was agreed upon in 1945, a peace without victory. Japan was not included, and thus was defeated that same year. Britain remains in a war economy, ready for any attack, and the allies are seemingly plotting for another major invasion perhaps with the peace being unstable. \n\n If you find any bugs make sure to report them in the bugs discussion, thanks in advance, helps everyone. \n\n Credits: Lev Slav and MisterJay"

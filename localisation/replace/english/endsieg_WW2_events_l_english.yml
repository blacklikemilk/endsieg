After that it was suggested they be interned at Scapa Flow, Britain with a skeleton crew of German sailors being guarded by the Grand Fleet and such was agreed upon. Once at Scapa Flow the mood amongst the sailors was still very mutinous and all of them had been heavily demoralized unable to go ashore and the food supplies coming from Germany of very poor quality. In addition none of the sailors were allowed to visit other ships or communicate. At the negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference the French and Italians wanted a quarter of the ships whilst the British wanted all of them destroyed since they saw redistribution as a threat to the supremacy of the Royal Navy. Rear-Admiral Ludwig von Reuter who had been given command of the ship's heard of the possible terms and began to prepare detailed plans to scuttle his ships, on June 18th he gave out orders which stated “It is my intention to sink the ships only if the enemy should attempt to obtain possession of them without the assent of our government.” While the signing of Versaille was scheduled for noon 21 June 1919 the First Battle Squadron prepared to board the German ships to check for signs of the crew preparing to scuttle however they had been misinformed the deadline of the treaty was extended to 19:00 23 June. Around 10:00 a.m. on 21 June 1919 Ludwig von Reuter sent a signal flag ordering the fleet to scuttle which began almost immediately. There was no noticeable effect until noon when the ‘Friedrich der Grosse’ began to list heavily starboard and all the ships hoisted the Imperial German Ensign on their main masts. It was a great disaster for the Allies as 52 of the 74 ships sunk. Whilst Admiral Fremantle in charge of the supervision of the German surface fleet scorned Von Reuter and his men he privately remarked “I could not resist feeling some sympathy for von Reuter, who had preserved his dignity when placed against his will in a highly unpleasant and invidious position."."

His group of tigers crossing an open terrain towards the high ground was ambushed by tanks from A Squadron 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry, A Squadron Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment, and B Squadron 144th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps.

 ww2_germany.118.d:0 "Kurt Knispal was a Sudeten German and is the most successful fighter in armored warfare with 168 (possibly as high as 195) confirmed tank kills, however he is very rarely heard of, why? \n\n Unlike Michael Wittmann who is perhaps the most famous tank ace then and now, Kurt Knispel on the other hand is relatively unknown despite his achievments. During his time serving in the armoured forces he fought in virtually every type of tank and served as a gunner, loader, and commander eventually receiving the Iron Cross First Class and Tank Assault Badge in Gold. \n\n Knispel however was never rapidly promoted or given the Knights Cross even though reccomended several times for it due to his rebellious attitude and getting into fights with his superiors as well as not being perfect "propaganda" material due to his neutrality towards the ideas of national socialism. Kurt Knispel never sought fame or recognition, he was just a very skilled tank commander, loader, gunner and described by his fellow comrades as friendly and very helpful and known for giving his comrades tank kills."

Within the Treaty of Frankfurt France was to cede to territories of Nancy and a small part of Champagne in mainland europe, however elsewhere Germany seized swathes of French colonial territory mostly in Mittelafrika to achieve their Mittelafrika Plan, otherwise Morocco had also been seized. In whole, the treaty forced France to disarm, make various territorial concesiions to Germany, as well pay reparations assessed at around 100 billion marks. Many French have viewed this as knife twist in the wound of the 1871 French defeat in the Franco-Prussian war."

This leaves the same possibility of practically anyone coming to power in Russia once a coup occurs. \n\n Remember...Murphy's Law, anything that can go wrong will go wrong."

 ww2_soviet.18.t:0 "The Xi'an Incident"
 ww2_soviet.18.d:0 "External pressure from the Soviet Union for the end of the hostilities between us and the Chinese Red Army has led to people in our ranks taking matters into their own hands. Two generals have had [Root.GetLeader] arrested, attempting to force a truce between us and the communists to unite China against external threats. International pressure for a peaceful solution, along with the weakness of China divided in this era are factors in favor of establishing a united front. What course should we take?"
 ww2_soviet.18.a:0 "Contact the communist party for peace talks."
 ww2_soviet.18.b:0 "Never!"
 ww2_soviet.19.t:0 "Nationalists Offer Truce"
 ww2_soviet.19.d:0 "Disagreements within the Nationalist ranks have led to a precarious situation. Their leader, [From.GetLeader] has been arrested in an effort to force our enemies to accept a truce with us to unite China against foreign enemies. Although we would like to see the Kuomintang leadership facing punishment for their crimes against us, this is a rare opportunity to cooperate and ensure that China does not fall in the hands of foreign imperialists."
 ww2_soviet.19.a:0 "We accept a truce for now."
 ww2_soviet.19.b:0 "The revolution cannot be set aside for this!"
 ww2_soviet.20.t:0 "Nationalist China Refuses Negotiations"
 ww2_soviet.20.d:0 "Despite the kidnapping of [From.GetLeader], the Nationalists have refused to enter negotiations for a truce with the Communists. Sadly, the Chinese will remain in violent conflict with their own people, making them easy prey for their enemies."
 ww2_soviet.20.a:0 "We did what we could."
 ww2_soviet.21.t:0 "Truce in Chinese Civil War"
 ww2_soviet.21.d:0 "The negotiations in Xi'an have borne results. Both Nationalists and Communists have agreed to a truce, putting an at least temporary end to the hostilities and allowing the parties to cooperate against foreign threats." 
 ww2_soviet.21.a:0 "There is hope for China yet."
 ww2_soviet.22.t:0 "Communist China Refuses Negotiations"
 ww2_soviet.22.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of Kuomintang generals to achieve a truce with the Communist Party leaders, the communists refuse to make even a temporary peace as long as the leader of the Nationalists is alive. It appears that the hostilities will not end so easily."
 ww2_soviet.22.a:0 "At this rate, China's enemies may divide and conquer."
 ww2_soviet.23.t:0 "Soviet Union Cedes Land"
 ww2_soviet.23.d:0 "The Soviet Union has other threats to worry about and does not wish to further increase hostilities with our Empire. As a sign of desiring peace between our nations, they have ceded some territory to us, hoping that this will strengthen our diplomatic ties."
 ww2_soviet.23.a:0 "Perhaps this can be a turning point."
 ww2_soviet.24.t:0 "The Fifth Column"
 ww2_soviet.24.d:0 "The persecution of enemies of the people, those who would reverse or subvert the revolution, has been ongoing policy since the Party came to power. The internal power struggles that followed have shifted our focus, and purging the Party ranks themselves has been given more emphasis since Trotsky's exile. Stalin has made himself an icon, but at the cost of making many real enemies and innumerable imaginary ones.\n\nHaving seen the worst of internal power struggles, the General Secretary is prone to act on the slightest suspicion. Being purged from the Party means imprisonment or death. Dark times lie ahead for those who show disloyalty - or just a bit too much loyalty to seem credible."
 ww2_soviet.24.a:0 "Are Zinoviev and his ilk still in touch with Trotsky?"
 ww2_soviet.25.t:0 "Trial of the Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center"
 ww2_soviet.25.d:0 "Despite Leon Trotsky being forced into exile, Joseph Stalin fears that he has secret supporters within the party. A series of rapid arrests and brutal interrogations have yielded confessions and testimonies conveniently pointing to some of Stalin's rivals. However, the more questions are asked and the deeper the secret police delves into letters and journals, the more people are implicated, if indirectly.\n\nParty members are beginning to believe that Stalin's absolute power and the death of his wife have isolated him to the point where he perceives anyone as a threat, but isn't that exactly what a traitor would say?"
 ww2_soviet.25.a:0 "Kalinin's wife is suspected. He cannot be trusted either."
 ww2_soviet.25.b:0 "Khrushchev dabbled with Trotskyism in the past. He must go."
 ww2_soviet.25.c:0 "Radek's confession points to several people within the party."
 ww2_soviet.25.e:0 "Party members can be trusted. This paranoia must cease."
 ww2_soviet.26.t:0 "Secret Trial of the Generals"
 ww2_soviet.26.d:0 "The Red Army has always been home to subversive elements, ever since Trotsky himself was Commissar of War. Documents acquired by the NKVD have implicated several high-ranking officers as not only traitors, but spies. Mikhail Tukhachevsky is among the most prominent of the suspects, and one Stalin is keen to rid the army of. Meanwhile, the navy's frequent contact with foreigners has led to many of them being arrested as well.\n\nAlthough there are documents from our enemies proving their guilt, there is no telling if they fabricated them, or if they were given false information by those who wanted this purge in motion to begin with."
 ww2_soviet.26.a:0 "Tukhachevsky must be tried in secret and executed immediately."
 ww2_soviet.26.b:0 "Rokossovsky refuses to confess, but cannot be allowed to live."
 ww2_soviet.26.c:0 "False documents and forced confessions are not proof."
 ww2_soviet.27.t:0 "Trial of the 21"
 ww2_soviet.27_tt:0 "Increases penalty from §YOfficers Purged§!"
 ww2_soviet.27_tt2:0 "§RWill lead to a civil war in the future.§!"
 ww2_soviet.27.d:0 "After several rounds of arrests and trials, the Great Purge has weaved a narrative that led up to this trial. Among the accused are not only old leaders like Nikolai Bukharin, but a number of diplomats, politicians, military officials and even many high-ranking NKVD officers. The charges are also more extensive than previously, including decade-old plots to murder Soviet leaders and sell the Union to its enemies.\n\nThe fact that the NKVD themselves are now among the targets of the purge has in a sense brought the proceedings in full circle. Threats and beatings have led to many confessing to all charges, even the most outlandish ones. The leading defendants face execution."
 ww2_soviet.27.a:0 "The navy and air force have been getting off easy so far."
 ww2_soviet.27.b:0 "As we suspected, enemies are everywhere."
 ww2_soviet.27.c:0 "This has gone too far. Soon we will have killed all of our own."
 ww2_soviet.28.t:0 "Trotskyist Coup"
 ww2_soviet.28.d:0 "The world may never know if Stalin's paranoia was targeting the right people, or whether he made more enemies trying to exterminate every Trotskyist in the Party. What is known is that what he feared eventually came to pass. Today, Leon Trotsky reemerged as having returned from his exile, and with the support of several influential party members and NKVD officers, launched a coup overthrowing Stalin's rule.\n\nThe former General Secretary was attacked in his home with an ice axe, and was swiftly executed along with several of his supporters. Tearing down the cult of personality he built up will take time, but the people know now at least that he was not immortal.\n\n One of the few survivors who managed to escape was Ivan Konev. The fierce supporter of Stalin has managed to gather some support and declared war on the Trotsky government, in an attempt to take back power and 'fulfill the vision of Comrade Stalin'."
 ww2_soviet.28.a:0 "Leaders come and go, but the people remain."
 ww2_soviet.29.t:0 "France wants to join the Comintern."
 ww2_soviet.29.d:0 "Our comrades in Parti Communiste Francais have made great progress. The nation of France is ready to join the Comintern."
 ww2_soviet.29.a:0 "A welcome addition"
 ww2_soviet.29.b:0 "No!"
 ww2_soviet.100.t:0 "Communists relent"
 ww2_soviet.100.d:0 "Due to the Soviet Union and ourselves being at war with a common enemy, they seem to have toned down support to our domestic communist parties."
 ww2_soviet.100.a:0 "Glad to be rid of them!"
 ww2_soviet.30.t:0 "Demand Bessarabia"
 ww2_soviet.30.d:0 "Romania cannot expect to withstand the might of the Red Army, if we send them a demand for our rightfully claimed land in Bessarabia they may just hand it over without a fight."

We grow stronger with each blow we take as we prepare to rise up and strike back with all the might of the [Prev.GetName]. Every soldier is willing to throw down their lives and stand firm against our enemies. We expect this to greatly benefit the training and commitment of our new officers even after this war is won!"

 ww2_soviet.48.t:0 "The Permanent Revolution"
 ww2_soviet.48.d:0 "Although countless people have been executed and imprisoned as traitors and counterrevolutionaries over the past years, leading positions have been largely safe. They have not been exempt from suspicion, however. With the creation of the Fourth International, Stalin appears posessed by the thought that those closest to him were never truly on his side. Those who try to gain his trust have further fueled this idea to cast themselves in a better light.\n\nThe current situation is one of exceptional irony: the distrust within the current administration has rendered it unsustainable, and a coup is now imminent. Some party members are arguing that reinviting Trotsky and turning the purges on the Stalinists could minimize the damage of the civil war that will ensue. Can this plan, which has been the General Secretary's greatest fear for years, truly be executed?"

 ww2_soviet.49.t:0 "The Second Russian Civil War"
 ww2_soviet.49.d:0 "With Stalin's increasing paranoia, the Party and military have become divided. Those who have managed to earn his trust - at least temporarily - want to keep him in power and retain the cult of personality he has built up, but many others have been informally cut out of the loop. Some of them believe that Stalin's rule has failed, others suspect they are simply waiting for the day when the NKVD will find or make an excuse to have them arrested.\n\nTogether, they have formed a faction powerful enough to challenge the current administration. Their stated goal is to overthrow Stalin's tyranny and transition from a totalitarian state, with a board of military officers overseeing the process.\n\nStalin's supporters in the military and the Party have rallied to retain the current regime, calling their opponents counterrevolutionary traitors. A new civil war is at hand."
 ww2_soviet.49.a:0 "Death to the traitors!"
 ww2_soviet.50.t:0 "Russian Liberation Army Founded"
 ww2_soviet.50.d:0 "The foundation of the Fourth International has reawakened Stalin's fear of traitors in the Party and military command. Having seen the trials and executions in the Great Purge, many suspect another one is incoming. In response, a number of generals led by Andrey Vlasov have formed the Committee for the Liberation of the People of Russia, with the goal of overthrowing Stalin's regime before it can do any more damage.\n\nAlthough the stated long-term goal is a transition to democracy, the exact form is unclear as of yet. All that is clear is that they intend to remove Stalin from power and end the rule of the Bolsheviks."
 ww2_soviet.50.a:0 "They must be stopped!"
 ww2_soviet.51.t:0 "NKVD Launch Coup"
 ww2_soviet.51.d:0 "The foundation of the Fourth International has reawakened Stalin's fear of traitors in the Party and military command. Having seen the trials and executions in the Great Purge, many suspect another one is incoming. The NKVD, which has been a crucial tool in the purges, has also been acutely aware of the fact that the agency itself a potential target. Rather than waiting to be imprisoned, executed and replaced, its leaders have decided to strike first and launch a coup with support from the similarly concerned military officials.\n\nHowever, despite its influential position, the NKVD has found it difficult to gain the trust of military leaders. The coup has only succeeded in gaining control of a limited area of the Union, but with the remnants of the old agency now facing certain execution, they are unlikely to surrender."
 ww2_soviet.51.a:0 "They must be captured!"
 ww2_soviet.52.t:0 "The Survivors' Coup"
 ww2_soviet.52.d:0 "The foundation of the Fourth International has reawakened Stalin's fear of traitors in the Party and military command. Having seen the trials and executions in the Great Purge, many suspect another one is incoming. With so many gone, there are only a few under suspicion who managed to avoid execution. Having been brutally interrogated and in some cases imprisoned, they know very well that they will be the first victims of another purge. In an act of desperation, these generals have decided to attempt to overthrow Stalin's regime before this happens.\n\nAlthough unlikely to succeed in the attempt, some survivors of the Great Purge have managed to seize control in some areas of the Union. The reign of the General Secretary has at the very least been destabilized."
 ww2_soviet.52.a:0 "We must stabilize it as quickly as possible."
 ww2_soviet.53.t:0 "The Successful Purge"
 ww2_soviet.53.d:0 "In the wake of the foundation of the Fourth International the hunt for Trotsky's supporters was intensified and several people close to Stalin were excecuted. Left with no one but himself, Stalin has retreated to his mansion. With every treacharous friend and family member finally dealt with he can now find some rest and focus fully on bringing glory to the Soviet Union."

 ww2_soviet.54.d_nopurge:0 "With the waning power of the communist party, it has long been clear that the Stalinist system is unsustainable.\nNew forces have risen up to seize power, invoking Russian ideals to guide our country along a new path.\n\nSymbolising this transition, [Root.GetLeader] has had Stalin deposed and placed in house arrest, far from the halls of power where he devised so many of his dangerous projects.\nAs a new Russian system grows to replace the decaying corpse of the Party, the secrecy, paranoia and political plotting of the old General Secretary is at an end."
 ww2_soviet.54.d_purge:0 "It has become clear that the greatest threat to the Russian state is not conspirators against the Communist Party, but the Party itself. With the disillusionment of the communist dream in Russia, new forces have seized power in order to bring our country into the future.\n\nFollowing the deposition of Stalin by [Root.GetLeader], the old General Secretary was given an expedient trial. His paranoid witch hunts being described as the destruction of the nation's leadership at a time of desperate need, Stalin was sentenced to death for treason. The old system goes with him into an unmarked grave."

 vanilla_poland.1.d:0 "Having been forced to cede Gdansk to the Germans, we are now locked in a vise between two empires threatening our sovereignty. As we're losing territory in the west, not being able to trust the Allies to protect us from German aggression, we could consider aligning with the German ambitions and reclaim portions of our old Commonwealth now absorbed into the Soviet Union. We will be easy prey if we remain neutral, and have fought too hard to see another partition of Poland."

 vanilla_poland.2.d:0 "Having reasserted their claims on our eastern territories, the Soviet Union has now put pressure on us to cede this land to them, suggesting that this is the only way to avoid another invasion and possible annexation or partition.\n\nOrdinarily, giving in to such threats easily would be out of the question, but the Soviet Union is far from our only concern. If we agree to their demands, we may have less to worry about on the eastern front, although it would also position the eastern front significantly further to the west."

 vanilla_poland.3.t:0 "Poland Cedes the East"
 vanilla_poland.3.d:0 "After we put pressure Poland to give in to our rightful claims on its eastern territories, they have agreed to cede what we demanded without further conflict. However, we can probably abandon any hopes of forming a stronger bond with the nation in the future. Having given us our due, they seem to hope we'll have as little contact as possible."

 vanilla_poland.4.d:0 "Despite our effort to resolve the dispute with Poland peacefully, they have refused to cede their eastern territories and forced us into a position where the only option for claiming them is through war.

 vanilla_poland.5.t:0 "Soviet Union Offers Protection"
 vanilla_poland.5.d:0 "After the Soviet Union claimed their right to eastern Poland, we assumed another attack as impending. However, a recent offer from the Soviets indicate otherwise. Apparently, provided we cede the claimed territory, they are willing to let us join them in an alliance. Furthermore, they promise that in the event of a war with Germany, we will be compensated for the loss by being granted new land in the west.\n\nWhile this may be a better offer than we expected, we can't know if this supposed future war will ever be pursued. Perhaps the Soviet Union is only looking for an easy land grab and forcing us into their sphere of influence. Nevertheless, it may be the best protection we can count on."

 vanilla_poland.7.d:0 "Despite making the most generous offer we possibly could, attempting an agreement where Poland would cede its eastern territory for a promise of a future share of Germany, [From.GetLeader] has rejected our diplomatic efforts.

Roosevelt, who has continued to campaign in favor of completing the programs he originally planned for his second term, is now running for president again. While he remains a popular candidate, Landon has continued to criticize his efforts to concentrate power in the hands of the president, and has accordingly avoided similar policies himself.\n\nThreats abroad, both to our own nation and others, remain a reality and neither candidate is in favor of the United States turning a blind eye to them.

 VAN_usa.8.b:0 "The Democrats. Roosevelt is prepared to do what's necessary."
 VAN_usa.9.t:0 "Roosevelt vs Dewey"
 VAN_usa.9.d:0 "The presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt has already been exceptional in many ways. Despite his declining health and the unprecedented length of his presidency, he aspires to continue leading our country through the war effort. The Republicans have been limited in their choices of candidates due to many potential nominees serving in the war, but have chosen Governor Thomas E. Dewey to represent them.\n\nRoosevelt continues to have popular support, but many suspect he may not live to see the end of his term. But is that sufficient to grant Dewey a victory over the man who has taken us this far?"
 VAN_usa.9.a:0 "FDR defeats Dewey."
 VAN_usa.9.b:0 "Dewey defeats FDR."
 VAN_usa.10.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] vs Roosevelt"
 VAN_usa.10.d:0 "Although many aspects of the New Deal were retained by [Root.GetLeader], Roosevelt still sees the opportunity to make his original plans for continued development of the programs reality. Despite declining health, he has managed to retain much of the support which landed him the presidency previously, and is now campaigning for the Democrats again.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] is arguing that a change of leadership in America's sensitive situation would be irresponsible, which is somewhat ironic since the same claim was made before his previous victory over Roosevelt. Despite this, he may have a point."
 VAN_usa.10.a:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has proven a capable leader."
 VAN_usa.10.b:0 "America is ready for a new New Deal."
 VAN_usa.11.t:0 "Roosevelt vs MacArthur"
 VAN_usa.11.d:0 "With the continued threat of being drawn into a war, both Democrats and Republicans have aspired to find a candidate from the military. General Douglas MacArthur, normally devoted to his military duties, has taken the opportunity to campaign for the Republican nomination while our nation is at peace and won. He is now challenging Roosevelt, supporting the conservative coalition.\n\nRoosevelt continues to be popular, but MacArthur's charisma and sense of duty has made a strong impression on voters. Does the military really know best?"
 VAN_usa.11.a:0 "Roosevelt and Truman will pull through."
 VAN_usa.11.b:0 "MacArthur is a man of peace as much as war."
 VAN_usa.12.t:0 "Campaign of Douglas MacArthur"
 VAN_usa.12.d:0 "To challenge Roosevelt's record-length presidency, the Republicans have looked to respected military commanders, hoping to find a potential candidate to take America through this war. General Douglas MacArthur has been a popular nominee among the conservatives, but he is also an indispensable asset in the ongoing conflict and has been reluctant to spend his time campaigning for the presidency.\n\nHe nevertheless remains one of the more promising conservative candidates and can perhaps be convinced to campaign to avoid getting a moderate Republican president. Is it worth the sacrifice?"
 VAN_usa.12.a:0 "MacArthur is needed more on the front lines than in the White House."
 VAN_usa.12.b:0 "We need him to challenge Roosevelt."
 VAN_usa.13.t:0 "Roosevelt Passes Away"
 VAN_usa.13.d:0 "Although President Roosevelt's health has been in decline for some time, his strong presidential campaign convinced many that he had many years left. However, the possibility of FDR's death while still in office has remained, and today he passed away after suffering a stroke. Vice-President Harry S. Truman has now taken the oath of office, requesting the support and prayers of the people. The old cabinet remains, and Truman has vowed to continue many of the policies of his predecessor."
 VAN_usa.13.a:0 "So ended an era, and so began another."

 VAN_usa.14.d:0 "Our great role-model, Nazi Germany, has betrayed their deepest principles and has allied themselves to the great enemy: The Communists. As the knowledge spreads, unrest follows in its wake. The people were willing to follow us this far, through fear of a Communist revolution, but with Germany's defection our great revival is being questioned."

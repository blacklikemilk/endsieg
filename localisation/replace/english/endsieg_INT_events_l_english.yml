 interwar_white_russia.1.d:0 "IMPORTANT PLEASE READ\n\n In the summer of 1918, the Southern Whites had two historical options. Each option was supported by two different leaders who expect to be the only commander in chief of the White movement. The first is Pyotr Krasnov, an autonomist leader of the Don Cossacks and former commander in chief of the Kerensky Republican Provisional Government of 1917. Krasnov is ready to ally with Ukraine and the new independent states from the former Russian Empire to fight the Bolsheviks. His priority is to attack Tsaritsyn and connect with the Eastern Whites before attacking Moscow with them.\n\n The second option was supported by Anton Denikin, leader of the Russian Volunteers. Denikin refuses to give up control of the Russian Empire territories and is not ready to recognize and ally with Ukraine and other neighboring countries from the former Tsars' Empire. Denikin's priority is to free the Kuban and North- Caucasus from the Bolsheviks before attacking Moscow from the South through the Ukraine. \N\N If you choose the Krasnov strategy and he succeeds in conquering the key town of Tsaritsyn this big victory will make him the leader of the Western Whites and, as the Don Cossack autonomist he would then ally with the Ukranian Nationalists instead of fighting them.

It determined the final southern border between the Republic of Austria and the newly formed Yugoslavia following WWI. The Carinthian area was disputed between both German-Austria and Yugoslavia but on November 5th, Yugoslav forces moved into the area which led to an amounting demand for a plebiscite for a region with a mixed population. The occupation of southeastern Carinthia by Yugoslav troops led to armed clashes. Before the plebiscite both sides waged intensive propaganda campaigns in which both promised a brotherhood particularly Austria. The results however were 59.1% in favor of adhesion to Austria and 40.9% in favor of annexation by Yugoslavia. Since the Austrian option gained a majority of votes in Slovene Zone A, the second stage of referendum in the Northern Zone B was not carried out and another Yugoslav foray was fiercely rejected by the Entente Powers."

It contained the Covenant of the League of Nations and as a result was not ratified by the United States. The treaty declared the Austro-Hungarian Empire had to be dissolved and the Austrian side accept responsibility for causing the war with the rest of the Central Powers. It included large sums of war money or war reparations to the allies and prevented Austria from refraining or directly/indirectly compromising its independence meaning it could not enter into a political or economic union with the German Reich without agreement from the LoN. The new republic's initial self-chosen name German-Austria had to be changed to Austria, concription was abolished, and the Austrian Army was limited to 30,000 volunteers. \n\n The vast reduction of population, territory, and resources, wreaked havoc on the economy and Vienna the former imperial capital was now left with no empire to administrate or support it. The countries very unity was called into question and unlike Hungary, Austria never had been a nation in the true sense of word even though it existed for 700 years, it had no unifying force other than loyalty to the Hapsburgs which were now deposed for good."

    hungary.7.d:0 "On March 26th 1921, during the Holy Saturday that year the dit (Parlamentum Publicum) was not in session and the diplomatic corps was away at the time in the country. The regent of Hungary, Horthy had planned a quiet holiday with his family in the royal palace. Charles had been informed by his Swiss entourage whom told the former emperor of promises from European royalist circles and prompted Charles to take advantage of ‘this quiet’ against the warnings of his many supporters and Horthy himself whom said the time was not right to return to the throne. This did not change his stance as he was optimistic. His secret negotiations with Aristide Briand the French Prime Minister promised French Support if he was to succeed and no armed intervention from Hungary’s neighbors the ‘Little Entente’ whom were very willing to all invade Hungary if a Habsburg came back to power. Charles left his Swiss villa arriving undetected at Szombathely on the 26th of March where he made his way to the palace of Count Janos Mikes a prominent legitimist, from there the news spread like wildfire amongst local legitimist and by the 27th of March Charles had already acquired a small privy council including Horthy’s Minister of Education. After Charles met with the Prime Minister, Pal Teleki, he replied to Charles saying “too soon, too soon” before Charles and urged him to return back to Switzerland saying a civil war would break out with an intervention of the Little Entente. Charles made a final agreement to meet with Horthy and once he arrived at the palace, he was completely unannounced just as Horthy was sitting down to an Easter dinner with his wife. After Horthy finished his soup he led Charles to the Regent’s Office and had a two hour ‘emotional’ discussion with Charles which Horthy described as “the most difficult moments in my entire life”. Charles thanked Horthy for his service as regent but said the time came to “hand over the power to me” with Horthy replying “This is a disaster. In the name of God, Your Majesty must leave at once and return to Switzerland, before it’s too late and the powers learn of your presence in Budapest”. Charles frustrated said he “burned his bridges” speaking in German he continuously argued with Horthy and reminded him of his tearful pledge of loyalty made at the Schonbrunn Palace in November 1918 and the sworn oath of obedience to him from which he was never released. Horthy retaliated he sworn an oath to Hungary and Charles shocked said he would stick by his position and gave Horthy 5 minutes to think over it. Horthy was skeptical of Charles’s claims of assurance from PM Briand and reiterated his fear of civil war. Horthy expected Charles to leave Hungary and either march on Vienna or retire to Switzerland."

By April 3rd, the French PM Briant denied any deal being made which severely weakened Charles’ position. With the army still loyal to Horthy, Charles reluctantly left by train on the 5th of April reaching Hertenstein Palace that day. He still proclaimed himself to be the rightful Hungarian ruler two days later which showed up on the newspaper and the Swiss government placed stricter limits on his political activity. Charles left Hungary with a great dislike toward Horthy believing that the Great powers would not oppose restoration and that he was holding the power for his own personal reasons. He thought the Hungarian people yearned for his return, though no demonstrations of support occurred in Hungary during the Easter Crisis except minor scale demonstrations in traditionally royalist counties. People had generally treated him with indifference and Teleki resigned on the 6th of April with his poor handling of affairs."

    hungary.9.d:0 "On October 23rd 1921 a Treaty of Versailles-mandated plebiscite was scheduled to occur in Burgenland, due to this Count Gyula Ostenburg-Moravek and Colonel Lehar as well as other legitimist officers decided to take advantage of the tense situation sending Charles a message that he should seize power before the 23rd of October saying that he would expect no opposition due to the political situation and his restoration would be greeted everywhere. Charles whom got the message after dictating his will made a daredevil flight (the plane’s engine stopped working several times) in an Ad Astra Aero Junkers F.13 monoplane landing surreptitiously in Western Hungary on a field belonging to a legitimist and from there making his way to Sopron. He had no intention to seek compromise with Horthy whose cabinet he considered illegitimate and formed his own provisional government. That day a group of armored trains were being equipped in Sopron guarded by Ostenburg’s troops who were told a communist rebellion erupted in Budapest with Horthy calling on Charles to restore order. The battalion took the traditional Honved oath of Loyalty to ‘Charles of Hapsburg, King of Hungary, and King of Bohemia’. From there they departed to Budapest 190 km away in the late morning. The armada stopped at each village station to have the local garrison and public officials take the oath of loyalty and to allow groups of loyal peasants chant ‘Long live the King!’ and pay homage to the royal couple. This took approximately 10 hours which then had allowed Horthy to regroup. A report reached Horthy late on October 21st and he was shocked Lehar and Ostenburg betrayed him and Horthy communicated his decision that force would be used if necessary citing the danger Hungary would be destroyed and made a military proclamation he would keep power and demanded loyalty from his army. Most who were stationed along the Royal Armada's path found it impossible to be disloyal to Charles. As Charles approached Budapest the Entente powers reaffirmed their opposition to the restoration and Czech, Yugoslav, and Rumanian ministers made it clear such a move would be regarded as a Casus Belli. Horthy then sent a letter telling Charles, begging him to give up but the latter did not even read the letter."

Martial law at this time was already declared in Budapest. Czechoslovakia at the same time reported and claimed to be mobilising. Thomas Hohler the British envoy was convinced all was lost anticipating that Charles would ender Budapest that afternoon. Horthy received news that if the legitimists launched an attack the defense of Budapest would collapse. General Pal Hegedus who was a legitimist allied with Charles met with Hohler the British envoy whom informed him that Britain “Would never recognise Charles and would never permit the return of a Habsburg.”. Later warning Budapest if taken by Royal Troops would be overrun by the Czechs within a week. Hegedus now denied being associated with Charles and offered brokering an armistice after learning that Charles' assurances that the Great Powers backed him were false. Horthy later that day met with a large volunteer force which had been guarding the city giving a speech warning if Charles came to power A-H would be revived and Hungary once again would resume her inferior position. He also said that Charles’ army consisted mostly of “Austrian and Czech Volunteers”. This emboldened the army which began firing on Charles's forces. After news of the Battle of Budaors (A village close to Budapest) was spread much of Charles' supporters were surprised and lost morale thinking the march would be Budapest. After Charles’ army saw that Horthy was determined to resist and found that Charles and his officers lied that there was an eruption of a Bolshevik rebellion in budapest support grew to Pro-Horthy. By now Charles reluctantly agreed to an armistice and arranged a truce the next morning."

In return of this all supporters of the restoration, “except agitators and ringleaders”, would be amnestied. Whilst Charles read these terms shots rang out and a stray bullet hit the royal train and the train started to move westward with Lehra and Ostenburg calling for a ‘Last Stand’ and ‘Fight to the last drop of blood’, but Charles was largely reluctant to do this and ordered the train to stop and opened the window yelling  "Lehár! Ostenburg! Stop and come back here! I forbid any more fighting! It's all quite senseless now...". He then dictated the final surrender order. Many prominent legitimists were arrested and Charles complied with every request except that he did not abdicate the throne for which was agreed upon from both parties."

In the Assembly, Punisa Racic, a member of the People's Radical Party got up and made a provocative speech which produced a stormy reaction from the opposition but Radic stayed compeltely silent, as Punisa Racic made his way to the speaker podium facing the Croats he put his hand in his pocket where he held a revolver, as he pulled out his gun Minister Vujicic grabbed his gun but he broke himself free and fired shots which killed Radic.

In june 1921, United states representatives present a withdrawal proposal, known as the Harding Plan, which called for Dominican ratification of all acts of the military government, approval of a loan of $2.5 million US dollars for public works and other expenses, the acceptance of United States officers of the constabulary, and the holding of elections under United States supervision. Popular reaction to the plan was overwhelmingly negative. Moderate Dominican leaders however, used the plan as the basis for further negotiations that resulted in an agreement between U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes and Dominican Ambassador to the United States Francisco J. Peynado on June 30th, 1922, allowing for the selection of a provisional president to rule until elections could be organized.

The White Army under the command of General Vladimir Kappel advanced toward Irkutsk while Kolchak was interrogated by a commission of five men representing the Revolutionary Committee (REVKOM) during nine days between the 21st of January and 6th of February. Despite the arrival of a contrary order from Moscow, Admiral Kolchak was condemned to death along with his Prime Minister, Viktor Pepelyaev. Both prisoners were brought before a firing squad in the early morning of 7 February 1920. According to eyewitnesses, Kolchak was entirely calm and unafraid, "like an Englishman." The Admiral asked the commander of the firing squad, "Would you be so good as to get a message sent to my wife in Paris to say that I bless my son?" The commander responded, "I'll see what can be done, if I don't forget about it." A priest of the Russian Orthodox Church then gave the last rites to both men. The squad fired and both men fell. The bodies were kicked and prodded down an escarpment and dumped under the ice of the frozen Angara River. When the White Army learned about the executions, its remaining leadership decided to withdraw farther east. The Great Siberian Ice March then followed. The Red Army did not enter Irkutsk until 7 March, and only then was the news of Kolchak's death officially released and the dream of restoring the Monarchy to Russia was crushed."

The Arctic winds at the same time blew unobstructed across the lake with many soldiers and their families freezing to death on the lake, during the spring the corpses and their possessions disappeared in the deepest lake in the world and Vladimir Kappel, one of the White Army generals fell victim to this as well. It is believed most of the Tsar’s Gold disappeared here sinking to the bottom of the lake."

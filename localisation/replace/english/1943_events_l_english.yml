    remaining_1943.1.d:0 "The Allied invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky, was a major campaign of World War II, in which the Allies took the island of Sicily from the Axis powers. It began with a large amphibious and airborne operation, followed by a six-week land campaign, and initiated the Italian Campaign. \nHusky began on the night of 9–10 July 1943, and ended on 17 August. Strategically, Husky achieved the goals set out for it by Allied planners; the Allies drove Axis air, land and naval forces from the island and the Mediterranean sea lanes were opened for Allied merchant ships for the first time since 1941. The Italian leader, Benito Mussolini, was toppled from power in Italy and the way was opened for the Allied invasion of Italy. The German leader, Adolf Hitler, \"canceled a major offensive at Kursk after only a week, in part to divert forces to Italy\", resulting in a reduction of German strength on the Eastern Front."

    germany.500.desc:0 "After the immense success in Africa, Erwin Rommel has been rewarded with the \"Order Of The Grand Cross Of The Iron Cross\", the second highest distinction a General or Field Marshal can obtain. He had fought with such high skill, such bravery, that he will forever be remembered by the German people."

    germany.501.t:0 "The Desert Fox dies!"
    germany.501.desc:0 "For a time, Erwin Rommel was Hitler's favorite general. Gaining prominence in 1940 as a commander of a panzer division that smashed the French defenses, Rommel went on to command the Afrika Korps where his tactical genius, ability to inspire his troops and make the best of limited resources, prompted Hitler to elevate him to the rank of Field Marshall. In 1943, Hitler placed Rommel in command of fortifying the \"Atlantic Wall\" along the coast of France defenses intended to repel the inevitable invasion of Europe by the Allies. \n\nBy the beginning of 1943, Rommel's faith in Germany's ability to win the war was crumbling, as was his estimation of Hitler. Touring Germany, Rommel was appalled at the devastation of the Allied bombing raids and the erosion of the peoples' morale. He also learned for the first time of the death camps, slave labor, the extermination of the Jews and the other atrocities of the Nazi regime. Rommel became convinced that victory for Germany was a lost cause and that prolonging the war would lead to his homeland's devastation. He came in contact with a growing conspiracy dedicated to ousting Hitler and establishing a separate peace with the western allies. \n\nOn July 17, 1944, Rommel's car was hit by an Allied aircraft strike, severely wounding the Field Marshall. He was taken to a hospital and then to his home in Germany. Three days later, an assassin's bomb nearly killed Hitler. In the gory reprisals that followed, some suspects implicated Rommel. Rommel's \"defeatist\" attitude was enough to warrant Hitler's wrath. He forced Rommel to either undergo a trial where he would certainly be found guilty or take his own life. He chose the latter."

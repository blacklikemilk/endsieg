 BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_NAME:0 "The Balkan Powder Keg"
 BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "Although constantly arguing over some new crises since the Vienna Conference a major European war has been avoided on the European continent for almost a hundred years. But increasingly so in the past few decades tensions have been increasingly rising in the Balkans with various empires seeking to secure their dominance in the region. It will only takes one small spark to blow the Balkan Powder keg."
 GE1_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "The German Empire was created at Versailles in 1871 with blood and iron after the defeat of France a year previously. But following the rise of Wilhelm II whom sacked Bismarck and his attempts at status quo Germany soon found itself with potential enemies on two fronts. These facts could not have been far from the German military’s mind as 1914 came: as Chief of Staff von Moltke put it - "war is inevitable, and the sooner the better". Time is running out. Can the 'place in the sun' and German dominance in the world still be achieved?"
 AUH_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "The Dual Monarchy had been created in 1867 from a compromise between Emperor Franz Josef and the nobility of Hungary. A patchwork empire, it was composed of eleven major ethnic groups. the empire centred around the capital, Vienna, and held together to a great degree by the strength of Emperor Franz Josef’s character. To limit Russian influence in the Balkans, Austria-Hungary aligned itself with Germany in 1879, and then with Italy in 1882 to form the Triple Alliance. However, with Germany the dominant party in the alliance, Austria-Hungary would find its foreign policy wishes subordinated to the desires of its senior partner. The rulers of Austria-Hungary."
 TUR_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "By the 18th century the Ottoman Empire was shrinking with its power eroded by a loss of internal authority and the expansionist ambitions of the European powers. The 19th century and early 20th century saw attempts at reform, including the creation of an executive branch, and a centralised government. But also witnessed the Ottoman Empire's substantial territorial decline. Meanwhile, the Turkish government was largely unable to collect its own taxes and the empire's communications and infrastructure remained primative, causing many to refer to Turkey as the "sick man of Europe". Can the Ottoman Empire modernise and survive or will it pass into the bygone era to where many argue it belongs?"
 RUS_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "Russia's eyes have fallen on the Balkans and Constantinople, which controls the vital sea route to the outside world. To support this ambition, Russia has the largest army in the world and a rapidly modernising industrial base. However, for all its strength Russia suffers from dangerous weaknesses and severe unrest amongst the populous. Some members of the Tsar's council advise that a "short, victorious war" might rally the people and distract them from their woes. But if the war went badly for Russia, could the Tsar's rule survive the consequences?"
 EN1_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "At the turn of the century, all appeared well for the British Empire - covering two-fifths of the world's land surface, accounting for a quarter of the world's population, policed by the most professional army in the world and guarded by the mightiest fleet ever built. But beneath the assurances of imperial grandeur lay insecurity about the future: economically and industrially, the United States was outperforming the British and the Germans had commenced an ominous fleet building program to challenge the Royal Navy's dominance of the seas."
 FR3_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "Once the greatest Power of Europe, France is now a troubled country. Economically, she has been overtaken by many of her rivals. A declining birthrate seems to promise further decline, and in an age of mass armies might prove a fatal weakness. Politically, the Third Republic is unstable. On the international scene, the defeat by Prussia in 1871 and Germany's occupation of the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine is a festering sore, and demands for 'revanche' - revenge - against Germany remain strong."
 US2_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "Since gaining independence from Great Britain in 1783 the United States and its people have mostly concerned themselves with their own continent, and to a lesser extent Central and South America, following the declaration of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823. Following the defeat of Spain in the Spanish-American War the United States has emerged as a world power, but with its very small army, is still not considered a 'Great Power' in the European sense, although it has vast potential to do so. This potential comes from the population and vast economy that in is greater than Britain, France, Russia and Germany combined."
 OTHER_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, will be affected by this conflict that spans across several continents around the world."

 SOMME_NAME:0 "The Battle of Verdun"
 SOMME_DESC:0 "The Great War has been going on for almost two years. After the German army launched a surprise attack through Belgium, the Tripple Entente was able to stop the advance. Both factions have dug into trenches and have been waging a fierce battle for a few kilometres of land every day ever since. "
 EN1_SOMME_DESC:0 "Britain does not suffer as much from the great war as France or the Russian Empire. Even if Britain is at war with the Central Powers, only volunteers have to take part in the war. The Royal Navy rules the waves and blocks trade routes to Germany across the North Sea."
 FR3_SOMME_DESC:0 "The Western Front in France is most likely the most important scene of the entire war. Both factions have become deep entrenched in trenches, and the sound of artillery fire burns into the heads of the soldiers. How long can they last? Only Time can tell."
 GE1_SOMME_DESC:0 "The Tripple Entente was able to stop the Schlieffen Plan just before Paris. The German Empire still has the Inintiative. We must take advantage of this and we must not waste time. The successes on the Eastern Front give our soldiers the confidence they need. God with us !"
 TUR_SOMME_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire has a major problems in the Middle East. But not only on the front line. Internal unrest is causing great problems for the sick man of Europe. Many peoples are calling for independence and freedom in the occupied territories. Drastic changes are needed."
 AUH_SOMME_DESC:0 "Germany's most important ally is increasingly in jeopardy. The dual monarchy, with its many different ethnic groups, does not seem to be up to the task of conflict. Comrades shooting at each other don't seem to be uncommon. It's all a matter of language."
 RUS_SOMME_DESC:0 "The Russian Empire is experiencing another disaster. After the embarrassing defeat against Japan in 1905, the poorly equipped Russian army has to hold its own against the German army. Not enough precautions have been made and now there is not even enough ammunition for the armed forces. It doesn't look good for the Russian tsar."

 KAISERSCHLACHT_NAME:0 "Kaiserschlacht"
 KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "For four years now a brutal stalemate has remained on the Western Front but in the east there is no longer a front with the collapse of the Russian Empire and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. It has allowed hundreds of thousands of German Soldiers to transfer to the west culminating in a plan for one final great offensive never before seen, the Kaiserschlacht. Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria however are in a very weak state and if a significant victory in the west does not happen it is very likely that not only will Germany collapse but the whole alliance."
 GE1_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "For four years now a military stalemate has lasted on the Western Front but with the surrender of the Russian Empire, Germany can use those divisions for a momentary numerical superiority over the allied forces on the Western Front. It is critical that we break through the front lines and force an armistice on France whilst the Americans are still in small numbers, once they come here we will stand no chance. The supply situation is getting worse every day and manpower is trickling away like sand through fingers. We have to put all of our effort together to make this one last push or suffer the consequences of capitulation."
 AUH_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The Austro-Hungarian Empire throughout the war has been a disaster but the October 1917 Battle of Caporetto has been a major victory for the Empire and the soon after collapse of the Russian Empire and Treaty of Brest-Litovsk  has relieved our forces in the east to focus on Italy and the Balkans. Though the Empire is still struggling to keep itself together with major war exhaustion and a large anti-war sentiment amongst the people. This will by no means be an task in either winning the war or keeping the empire intact, or both..."
 TUR_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The Allies thought that Turkey would be a pushover, but the war in the Middle East went its own wild way. A struggling empire that is seriously behind in almost every term compared to the west, the Ottoman Empire has managed to hold on four long years of fighting however the tide has turned and the British have taken Jerusalem the holy city, along with Baghdad and is now advancing from both Mesopotamian and Jordan-Israeli fronts towards Damascus and Mosul. If they are to fall so will we, however with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk signed, our forces in the caucasus are finally free for other use."
 SOV_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "Over the course of the Great War the weak Russian Empire grew heavily unstable and many lives were lost to which the soldiers and working class alike lost any trust and patriotism towards the Imperial Government and has formed its own Communist Government led by Vladimir Lenin. The disastrous Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed but we had no choice, and now in the midst of all this there is still a larger conflict ahead of us, the Russian Civil War."
 EN1_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom has fought in the fields of Flanders, the plains of Africa, and in the desert of the Middle East. Tremendous amounts of life has been lost over the course of the war and a victory does not seem any closer at times, but with the naval blockade against Germany, our enemy is severely weakened with mass starvation of civilians and military alike as well a heavy decline in morale and war effort. Whilst we are no better with our own war effort as it loses popularity by the day the Americans will soon arrive and provide fresh troops and a industrial superiority over the Central Powers, but we must survive the onslaught of the Ludendorff Offensive first."
 FR3_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The French people desperately outnumbered and outgunned by the Germans have fought on for four years with assistance of the British but the front has barely moved in those four years with a tremendous amount of life that has been lost with it. The Germans however have not managed to break through, not in Verdun, and not on the Belgian Front, however with their troops relieved from Russia they will gain numerical superiority against us, on the flip side the Americans will soon come and relieve us with fresh troops so we must hang on."
 US2_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The United States has largely remained neutral throughout the Great War but with the sinking of the Lusitania, Zimmerman Telegram, and the Black Tom sabotage as well as the loans we have given to the Allied Powers for which we must see repaid, we have been forced to enter the Great War or else face a grave loss of money if the Allied Forces fall. But whilst we have joined the war the year before, the transfer of troops has taken a lot longer than expected and we will only start arriving in Europe in large numbers in the following months."

The first phase was the first and only attack along the entire frontline, and captured a huge stroke of USSR territories.

 FRA_OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_DESC:0 "With the rapid breakthrough of the German troops through the Ardennes and the subsequent encirclement of france's best troops, the Third French Republic considered the continuation of the war to be pointless. The north of the country is occupied by the Germans and in the south a puppet state was installed under Phillipe Petaine. Now it is up to the remaining forces, who are still loyal to the third French Republic, to continue the struggle."

After the invasion of Poland in September 1939, the Third Reich and its "invincible army" won one victory after another. However, the tide seems to be turning slowly.

The next target is perhaps the Japanese mainland itself..."

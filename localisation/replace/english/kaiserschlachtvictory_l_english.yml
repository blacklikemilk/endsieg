 kaiserschlachtvictory.1.t:0 "Send a peace offer to the French?"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.1.d:0 "We have taken control of Northern France, and thus the bulk of French industry and resources. We have entered the gates of Paris and Versailes, just as we have in 1871. Shall we end this war, just as our forefathers have, with an honourable peace?"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.1.a:0 "Send the offer. We shall ensure that this time, the peace shall remain."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.1.b:0 "No, we shall conquer all!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.2.t:0 "Germany proposes armistice!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.2.d:0 "We have lost the bulk of our industry, resources, and most importantly our capital city, Paris. Whilst we could resist the dreaded Boche, chances are that the Germans are going to only give us harsher terms if we were to refuse the armistice now."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.2.a:0 "We must end this war, even if we are on the losing side."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.2.b:0 "We shall fight to the bitter end."

 kaiserschlachtvictory.3.t:0 "The French refuse the armistice!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.3.d:0 "The French have refused our offer of an armistice! We have no choice but to fight to the bitter end now."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.3.a:0 "If the French wish to continue this senseless slaughter, so be it."

 kaiserschlachtvictory.4.t:0 "France Surrenders! Armistice of Marne Signed!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.4.d:0 "With our successful Spring Offensive, the so-called Kaiserschlacht, as the soldiers are calling it now, and the subsequent capture of Paris, the Third French Republic has officially agreed to an armistice which has been signed at Marne today ending the war between our two countries. France has agreed to demobilize its military and expel British forces from the mainland as soon as possible with a peace treaty to be soon written under our termss. \n\n With the French out of the war, the rest of the Entente shall follow suit with negotiations on an armistice and final treaty soon."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.4.a:0 "We are victorious!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.5.t:0 "The French have accepted the German Armistice"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.5.d:0 "The French have agreed to an armistice with the Germans, and as such, the war on mainland Europe is over. Regardless of victories and defeats in battles, it would seem that the war is sadly lost. With the French out of the war, it will only be a matter of time before the Germans come streaming through the Turks to retake Africa, and our economy and people will never support a never-ending war."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.5.a:0 "To a peace, with honor."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.5.b:0 "Britons shall never be slaves!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.6.t:0 "Britain Agrees to Armistice!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.6.d:0 "With the fall of France and the expulsion of British forces from mainland Europe the United Kingdom has bitterly agreed to an Armistice between our two nations which has been signed today at Calais. While the process of drawing up a final treaty shall start soon between our nations it is unlikely that we will be able to make any drastic decisions as the United Kingdom still has the worlds largest fleet and the best protection from invasion in the form of an island."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.6.a:0 "Victory is ours!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.7.t:0 "The British refuse the peace!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.7.d:0 "The British have refused our offers of ceasefire, although whether we will go to war with them again remains to be seen..."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.7.a:0 "Preposterous!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.8.t:0 "Peace with the Central Powers?"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.8.d:0 "Since turning our backs on the Triple Alliance, now the Central Powers, it would seem that the promises that Britain and France made will never come to fruition. As much as we wish for Italy to be unified, it would seem that we should have chosen to reclaim our old posessions in France instead..."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.8.a:0 "Let us hope for a lenient peace."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.8.b:0 "The dream of Italia Irridente, a unified Italy, shall never die!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.9.t:0 "Italy Agrees to Armistice"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.9.d:0 "With France gone and the United Kingdom with the Americans shortly following suite the Italians have reluctantly agreed to an Armistice near Vittorio Veneto along with pressure of the people to whom the unpopularity of the war has grown very much over these past few years, the process of drawing up a final treaty shall begin soon."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.9.a:0 "They should've stayed with us!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.10.t:0 "Italy refuses Armistice!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.10.d:0 "The Italians have chosen to fight on to the bitter end. With diplomacy failing us in this our of need we will have to do this the hard way."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.10.a:0 "Fools!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.10.b:0 "Traitorous scum!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.11.t:0 "The German Empire offers an Armistice!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.11.d:0 "A distant war in Europe, wars that we usually do not care for yet were dragged into this time. The Germans promise lenient terms on us, as well as no reperations of any sort. In essence, we're going off scot-free. What shall we do?"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.11.a:0 "This was not our war."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.11.b:0 "We shall fight to the end!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.12.t:0 "Americans Agree to Armistice!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.12.d:0 "The Americans who have just last year joined the war taking a major part only early this year have agreed to an Armistice at Calais with the British following the surrender of France, the peace which stands between our two nations is and will be a white peace with the Americans most likely returning back to their isolationist stature."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.12.a:0 "Huzzah! Bread!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.13.t:0 "Americans refuse armistice!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.13.d:0 "Despite our lenient peace offer, the Americans have rejected our offers of peace."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.13.a:0 "Then so be it. We shall learn to invade them in time..."

 kaiserschlachtvictory.14.t:0 "A letter from the Emperor of Germany"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.14.d:0 "The Empires of Japan and Germany are distant and share a lack of respect from the international stage. Sakhalin, a prize rightfully won by the Japanese in the 1905 war was denied to you from a lack of respect by the British and Americans. The German Empire is willing to include transfers of French Indochina in the final peace treaty, as well as any islands held by the Japanese Empire that currently belong to the Deutches Kaiserreich. The empire of Germany is willing to treat the Empire of Japan as an equal on the international stage, and foster a future friendship with it."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.14.a:0 "Very well. Peace it is."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.14.b:0 "This seems too good to be true.."

 kaiserschlachtvictory.15.t:0 "The Japanese have accepted an armistice!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.15.d:0 "The Japanese have accepted an armistice, with a letter written by Wilhelm II himself appealing to the Emperor of Japan. Although its precise contents are unknown, we will likely have to give up a few concessions in the east to satisfy them."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.15.a:0 "They're just some desolate islands anyway."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.16.t:0 "Japanese decline armistice"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.16.d:0 "The Japanese have declined peace, despite a letter by the Wilhelm II supposedly clamoring for peace."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.16.a:0 "Our Emperor can't do diplomacy very well, now can he?"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.17.t:0 "Peace?"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.17.d:0 "Our participation in this distant European war is largely nominal. A formal cessation of hostilities will change very little on the ground, but we could ask for the status of the German concessions."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.17.a:0 "Let's not push it. Ask for peace regardless of the terms."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.17.b:0 "We want Qingdao!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.17.c:0 "We will continue this war, on paper at least!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.18.t:0 "Chinese armistice - recognition of German Qingdao"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.18.d:0 "The Chinese have oddly allowed our concession at Qingdao to stand, and should the Chinese actually have control over Qingdao, we shall resume our normal administration promptly. However, should another country, such as Japan hold it, they wll not evacuate the treaty port."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.18.a:0 "Okay."

 kaiserschlachtvictory.19.t:0 "The Fate of Tsingdao"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.19.d:0 "The Chinese agree to a peace only if we recognize the end of our concessions there. We may not necessarily control them, however..."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.19.a:0 "Give it to them."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.19.b:0 "Back their claim!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.19.c:0 "Tsingdao is rightfully German!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.20.t:0 "Transfer Tsingdao?"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.20.d:0 "Germany has confirmed posession of Qingdao/Tsingdao with China, but it is currently in our hands. Shall we recognize the claim?"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.20.a:0 "Yes, transfer Qingdao to the Chinese."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.20.b:0 "No, Qingdao is ours!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.21.t:0 "Chinese refuse armistice"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.21.d:0 "Even with the de facto cessation of hostilities, the Chinese have oddle decided to keep fighting us on paper."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.21.a:0 "Odd."

 kaiserschlachtvictory.22.t:0 "We have lost Qingdao!"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.22.d:0 "We have lost control over Qingdao, and the Chinese have incorporated it into their state. What shall we do?"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.22.a:0 "We are defeated. Sign it off."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.22.b:0 "We shall retake it, and then some."

 kaiserschlachtvictory.23.t:0 "Yet another humiliation."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.23.d:0 "We have lost yet another war to the filthy barbarians, and yet the people are calling for our surrender of territories. What now?"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.23.a:0 "Accept the loss of Qingdao."
 kaiserschlachtvictory.23.b:0 "We shall drive them off Chinese soil!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.25.a:0 "Blast!"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.123.t:0 "The fate of Belgium"

 kaiserschlachtvictory.129.d:0 "Egypt is currently an English de facto protectorate. However, it was part of the Ottoman empire for a very long time beforehand, and briefly an independent state under Muhammad Ali. What demands are to be made here? I suggest that we gain control of the Suez, personally, sir.

 kaiserschlachtvictory.242.desc:0 "The French claim on Alsace-Lorraine helped spark this war, and Bismarck was against annexing any land from the French. However, the French are in no position to bargain, and it seems that the German military have already made preperations to annex a strip of Lorraine from Nanzig to Briey-Longwy. Presumably, in the case of yet another war, these forts that the French built will be used against them..."

 kaiserschlachtvictory.248.d:0 "Kuwait in southmost Iraq could be used as a strategic port by us however, it would likely not be as important now with us owning most of Middle Africa, though it wouldn't hurt, on the other hand we could always be fair and just and give it back to the Ottoman Empire whom would surely appreciate the return of this territory from British Imperialism."

 kaiserschlachtvictory.249.t:0 "The fate of French Indochina"
 kaiserschlachtvictory.249.d:0 "With the French having capitulated, they will be in no position to manage their colonies in Asia. These are very precarious and found on the other end of the world, and as much as we would like them for their rubber plantations, the Japanese also desire colonial posessions. We can make a long-term ally in the region should war erupt once more against the British by giving the Japanese Asian posessions despite losing the war."

 kaiserschlachtvictory.250.d:0 "The Japanese have seized our posessions in the Pacific during the war, and are unwilling to return them. There is nothing in these islands anyway, and we absolutely cannot contest the United States' navy. However, Japan has an interest in them, and we could actually make a profit by ratifying a deal with Japan for these Islands."

 kaiserschlachtvictory.251.t:0 "A fair offer."

In the treaty we will cede all of the Baltic States to Germany meant to become German vassal states under German princelings, recognize the independence of Ukraine, cede Byelorussia, cede Kars Oblast in the South Caucasus to the Ottoman Turks.

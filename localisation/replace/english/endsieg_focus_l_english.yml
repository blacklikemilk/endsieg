Following the Fall of France, we had hoped the English would seek an armistice, but seeing as they declined we will have to resort to more definitive measures. To dare this operation, we would need an immense amount of vessels and air support."
    GER_fall_grun:0 "Fall Grün"

We still control large portions of the Soviet union, enough to fight a staggered retreat across the front to wear down the Soviets, but before we can begin defensive operations we must make one more offensive to stabalize the frontline."

The majority of the Soviet forces are situated in and around Moscow and along our central front. We have the option to strike south and capture the vital baku oil fields, along with the City of Stalins name, which would be a striking blow to the Bolsheviks."

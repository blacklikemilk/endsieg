Being defeated twice already the allies preceding artillery preparation and assault had a devastating effect on Bulgarian morale which led to mass desertions along the front in a chaotic manner. After the allies captured the former HQ of Uskub and endangered the remenants of the 11th Army with the development of an anti-moanrchist Radomir Rebellion, the Kingdom of Bulgaria was forced to sign the Armistice of Salonica and withdrew from the war. \n\n If you're a player you get the idea 'Vardar Offensive' which gives you tons of bonuses, good luck!"

interwar_white_russia.1.d:0 "IMPORTANT PLEASE READ\n\n In the summer of 1918, the Southern Whites had two historical options. Each option was supported by two different leaders who expect to be the only commander in chief of the White movement. The first is Pyotr Krasnov, an autonomist leader of the Don Cossacks and former commander in chief of the Kerensky Republican Provisional Government of 1917. Krasnov is ready to ally with Ukraine and the new independent states from the former Russian Empire to fight the Bolsheviks. His priority is to attack Tsaritsyn and connect with the Eastern Whites before attacking Moscow with them.\n\n The second option was supported by Anton Denikin, leader of the Russian Volunteers. Denikin refuses to give up control of the Russian Empire territories and is not ready to recognize and ally with Ukraine and other neighboring countries from the former Tsars' Empire. Denikin's priority is to free the Kuban and North- Caucasus from the Bolsheviks before attacking Moscow from the South through the Ukraine. \N\N If you choose the Krasnov strategy and he succeeds in conquering the key town of Tsaritsyn this big victory will make him the leader of the Western Whites and, as the Don Cossack autonomist he would then ally with the Ukranian Nationalists instead of fighting them.

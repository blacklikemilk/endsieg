However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action.

One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."

The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost.

The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war.

Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense.

Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."

Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid.

Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well.

ww1_germany.61.d:0 "On the 21st of April 1918, after the fog has lifted over Cappy Airfield JG1 took off after reports of enemy air activity reports. Jasta 11 takes off led by Manfred von Richtofen (The Red Baron), with Hans Joachim-Wolff, and Richtofen's cousin Wolfram who is heading into battle for the first time. \n\n At 1150 hours, Mellersh spots a lone Triplane, half rolls and forces him down. May circles on the edge of the fight until he sights Richtofen's cousin Wolfram crossing his front, Richtofen sees his cousin under fire and closes in, opens fire. The inexperienced May, falls out of control probably saving his life. Richtofen breaks his own rule and follows him down as May plunges earthward but he regains control just over the Somme and follows the river West - and to the safety of his own lines. May's friend Roy Brown sees the pursuit and dives to help, a low level chase follows. With a strong easterly win, Richtofen is pushed further and further over enemy lines... alone... and under constant ground fire. Richtofen seems to become target fixated, unaware of Brown diving behind him; at this exact time Cedric Popkin, of the 24th Australian Machine Gun Company fires at the Red Triplane along with soldiers from the 53rd Battery, Royal Australian Artillery. As Brown fires a burst the Triplane rears up to the right, at 1200 hours near Vaux-sur-Somme, Richtofen receives a single, fatal, bullet wound to the chest. The Red Triplane Fokker falls vertically but pulls up at the last moment, most likely still under the control of Richtofen, but by the time the aircraft stops... Richtofen is dead. To this day nobody who knows who killed the Red Baron as the Sopwith and the ground fire both used the Vickers .303. However May, Mellersh, and LeBoutillier all claim to have seen the Triplane rear up as Roy Brown fired, though the shot that enetered the under right of his armpit exiting under his left nipple gave high credence to groundfire bringing him down."

No plausible suspect or reason for the explosion could be found and it is reported the cordite in her magazine might have spontaneously ignored due to decomposition.

The rice riots are said to be unparalleled to any other sort of protest in the past on terms of scope, size, and violence. The initial protest was said to have started peacefully but the disturbance quickly escalated into full scale riots, strikes, looting, incendiary bombings of police stations, and government offices, as well as armed clashes. Some 25,000 people were arrested, with 8200 being convicted of various crimes.

His priority is to attack Tsaritsyn and connect with the Eastern Whites before attacking Moscow with them.\n\n The second option was supported by Anton Denikin, leader of the Russian Volunteers. Denikin refuses to give up control of the Russian Empire territories and is not ready to recognize and ally with Ukraine and other neighboring countries from the former Tsars' Empire. Denikin's priority is to free the Kuban and North- Caucasus from the Bolsheviks before attacking Moscow from the South through the Ukraine. \N\N If you choose the Krasnov strategy and he succeeds in conquering the key town of Tsaritsyn this big victory will make him the leader of the Western Whites and, as the Don Cossack autonomist he would then ally with the Ukranian Nationalists instead of fighting them. Last but not least, it would be a first step to unite the White factions on the Volga"

The occupation of southeastern Carinthia by Yugoslav troops led to armed clashes. Before the plebiscite both sides waged intensive propaganda campaigns in which both promised a brotherhood particularly Austria. The results however were 59.1% in favor of adhesion to Austria and 40.9% in favor of annexation by Yugoslavia.

It included large sums of war money or war reparations to the allies and prevented Austria from refraining or directly/indirectly compromising its independence meaning it could not enter into a political or economic union with the German Reich without agreement from the LoN. The new republic's initial self-chosen name German-Austria had to be changed to Austria, concription was abolished, and the Austrian Army was limited to 30,000 volunteers. \n\n The vast reduction of population, territory, and resources, wreaked havoc on the economy and Vienna the former imperial capital was now left with no empire to administrate or support it.

The regent of Hungary, Horthy had planned a quiet holiday with his family in the royal palace. Charles had been informed by his Swiss entourage whom told the former emperor of promises from European royalist circles and prompted Charles to take advantage of ‘this quiet’ against the warnings of his many supporters and Horthy himself whom said the time was not right to return to the throne. This did not change his stance as he was optimistic. His secret negotiations with Aristide Briand the French Prime Minister promised French Support if he was to succeed and no armed intervention from Hungary’s neighbors the ‘Little Entente’ whom were very willing to all invade Hungary if a Habsburg came back to power. Charles left his Swiss villa arriving undetected at Szombathely on the 26th of March where he made his way to the palace of Count Janos Mikes a prominent legitimist, from there the news spread like wildfire amongst local legitimist and by the 27th of March Charles had already acquired a small privy council including Horthy’s Minister of Education. After Charles met with the Prime Minister, Pal Teleki, he replied to Charles saying “too soon, too soon” before Charles and urged him to return back to Switzerland saying a civil war would break out with an intervention of the Little Entente. Charles made a final agreement to meet with Horthy and once he arrived at the palace, he was completely unannounced just as Horthy was sitting down to an Easter dinner with his wife. After Horthy finished his soup he led Charles to the Regent’s Office and had a two hour ‘emotional’ discussion with Charles which Horthy described as “the most difficult moments in my entire life”. Charles thanked Horthy for his service as regent but said the time came to “hand over the power to me” with Horthy replying “This is a disaster. In the name of God, Your Majesty must leave at once and return to Switzerland, before it’s too late and the powers learn of your presence in Budapest”. Charles frustrated said he “burned his bridges” speaking in German he continuously argued with Horthy and reminded him of his tearful pledge of loyalty made at the Schonbrunn Palace in November 1918 and the sworn oath of obedience to him from which he was never released. Horthy retaliated he sworn an oath to Hungary and Charles shocked said he would stick by his position and gave Horthy 5 minutes to think over it. Horthy was skeptical of Charles’s claims of assurance from PM Briand and reiterated his fear of civil war. Horthy expected Charles to leave Hungary and either march on Vienna or retire to Switzerland."

By April 3rd, the French PM Briant denied any deal being made which severely weakened Charles’ position. With the army still loyal to Horthy, Charles reluctantly left by train on the 5th of April reaching Hertenstein Palace that day. He still proclaimed himself to be the rightful Hungarian ruler two days later which showed up on the newspaper and the Swiss government placed stricter limits on his political activity. Charles left Hungary with a great dislike toward Horthy believing that the Great powers would not oppose restoration and that he was holding the power for his own personal reasons. He thought the Hungarian people yearned for his return, though no demonstrations of support occurred in Hungary during the Easter Crisis except minor scale demonstrations in traditionally royalist counties. People had generally treated him with indifference and Teleki resigned on the 6th of April with his poor handling of affairs."

hungary.9.d:0 "On October 23rd 1921 a Treaty of Versailles-mandated plebiscite was scheduled to occur in Burgenland, due to this Count Gyula Ostenburg-Moravek and Colonel Lehar as well as other legitimist officers decided to take advantage of the tense situation sending Charles a message that he should seize power before the 23rd of October saying that he would expect no opposition due to the political situation and his restoration would be greeted everywhere. Charles whom got the message after dictating his will made a daredevil flight (the plane’s engine stopped working several times) in an Ad Astra Aero Junkers F.13 monoplane landing surreptitiously in Western Hungary on a field belonging to a legitimist and from there making his way to Sopron. He had no intention to seek compromise with Horthy whose cabinet he considered illegitimate and formed his own provisional government. That day a group of armored trains were being equipped in Sopron guarded by Ostenburg’s troops who were told a communist rebellion erupted in Budapest with Horthy calling on Charles to restore order. The battalion took the traditional Honved oath of Loyalty to ‘Charles of Hapsburg, King of Hungary, and King of Bohemia’. From there they departed to Budapest 190 km away in the late morning. The armada stopped at each village station to have the local garrison and public officials take the oath of loyalty and to allow groups of loyal peasants chant ‘Long live the King!’ and pay homage to the royal couple. This took approximately 10 hours which then had allowed Horthy to regroup. A report reached Horthy late on October 21st and he was shocked Lehar and Ostenburg betrayed him and Horthy communicated his decision that force would be used if necessary citing the danger Hungary would be destroyed and made a military proclamation he would keep power and demanded loyalty from his army. Most who were stationed along the Royal Armada's path found it impossible to be disloyal to Charles. As Charles approached Budapest the Entente powers reaffirmed their opposition to the restoration and Czech, Yugoslav, and Rumanian ministers made it clear such a move would be regarded as a Casus Belli. Horthy then sent a letter telling Charles, begging him to give up but the latter did not even read the letter."

Martial law at this time was already declared in Budapest. Czechoslovakia at the same time reported and claimed to be mobilising. Thomas Hohler the British envoy was convinced all was lost anticipating that Charles would ender Budapest that afternoon. Horthy received news that if the legitimists launched an attack the defense of Budapest would collapse. General Pal Hegedus who was a legitimist allied with Charles met with Hohler the British envoy whom informed him that Britain “Would never recognise Charles and would never permit the return of a Habsburg.”. Later warning Budapest if taken by Royal Troops would be overrun by the Czechs within a week. Hegedus now denied being associated with Charles and offered brokering an armistice after learning that Charles' assurances that the Great Powers backed him were false. Horthy later that day met with a large volunteer force which had been guarding the city giving a speech warning if Charles came to power A-H would be revived and Hungary once again would resume her inferior position. He also said that Charles’ army consisted mostly of “Austrian and Czech Volunteers”. This emboldened the army which began firing on Charles's forces. After news of the Battle of Budaors (A village close to Budapest) was spread much of Charles' supporters were surprised and lost morale thinking the march would be Budapest. After Charles’ army saw that Horthy was determined to resist and found that Charles and his officers lied that there was an eruption of a Bolshevik rebellion in budapest support grew to Pro-Horthy. By now Charles reluctantly agreed to an armistice and arranged a truce the next morning."

In return of this all supporters of the restoration, “except agitators and ringleaders”, would be amnestied. Whilst Charles read these terms shots rang out and a stray bullet hit the royal train and the train started to move westward with Lehra and Ostenburg calling for a ‘Last Stand’ and ‘Fight to the last drop of blood’, but Charles was largely reluctant to do this and ordered the train to stop and opened the window yelling  "Lehár! Ostenburg! Stop and come back here! I forbid any more fighting! It's all quite senseless now...". He then dictated the final surrender order.

Popular reaction to the plan was overwhelmingly negative. Moderate Dominican leaders however, used the plan as the basis for further negotiations that resulted in an agreement between U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes and Dominican Ambassador to the United States Francisco J. Peynado on June 30th, 1922, allowing for the selection of a provisional president to rule until elections could be organized.

Rear-Admiral Ludwig von Reuter who had been given command of the ship's heard of the possible terms and began to prepare detailed plans to scuttle his ships, on June 18th he gave out orders which stated “It is my intention to sink the ships only if the enemy should attempt to obtain possession of them without the assent of our government.” While the signing of Versaille was scheduled for noon 21 June 1919 the First Battle Squadron prepared to board the German ships to check for signs of the crew preparing to scuttle however they had been misinformed the deadline of the treaty was extended to 19:00 23 June.

The region was detached from East Prussia in the Treaty of Versailles and became a mandate of the League of Nations and placed under provisional French administration until a more permanent solution could be worked out. Lithuania wanted to unite with the region due to the large Lithuanian-speaking minority and the major port in Memel was the only viable access to the Baltic Sea for Lithuania. As the Conference of Ambassadors instead favored leaving the region as a small free city like the Free City of Danzig the Lithuanians organized and staged a revolt as a consequence which ended to the region being given to Lithuania."

During his time serving in the armoured forces he fought in virtually every type of tank and served as a gunner, loader, and commander eventually receiving the Iron Cross First Class and Tank Assault Badge in Gold. \n\n Knispel however was never rapidly promoted or given the Knights Cross even though reccomended several times for it due to his rebellious attitude and getting into fights with his superiors as well as not being perfect "propaganda" material due to his neutrality towards the ideas of national socialism. Kurt Knispel never sought fame or recognition, he was just a very skilled tank commander, loader, gunner and described by his fellow comrades as friendly and very helpful and known for giving his comrades tank kills."

Though they are technically our puppet, if a change in leadership changes we could be threatened. \n\n Forming an independent Egypt would severely limit our further limits of demands from the British however this would remove all British power projection in the mediterranean and guarantee the Egyptian Sultanate as a de facto puppet of the Empire. \n\n Giving Egypt to the Turks would also limit our demands later on and if our alliance with the Turks splits later on we won't have any of these benefits \n\n Incorporating Egypt as our colony would be perhaps the most drastic decision drawing up a lot of infamy and severely limiting further negotiations."

Within the Treaty of Frankfurt France was to cede to territories of Nancy and a small part of Champagne in mainland europe, however elsewhere Germany seized swathes of French colonial territory mostly in Mittelafrika to achieve their Mittelafrika Plan, otherwise Morocco had also been seized. In whole, the treaty forced France to disarm, make various territorial concesiions to Germany, as well pay reparations assessed at around 100 billion marks.

Despite the arrival of a contrary order from Moscow, Admiral Kolchak was condemned to death along with his Prime Minister, Viktor Pepelyaev. Both prisoners were brought before a firing squad in the early morning of 7 February 1920. According to eyewitnesses, Kolchak was entirely calm and unafraid, "like an Englishman." The Admiral asked the commander of the firing squad, "Would you be so good as to get a message sent to my wife in Paris to say that I bless my son?" The commander responded, "I'll see what can be done, if I don't forget about it." A priest of the Russian Orthodox Church then gave the last rites to both men. The squad fired and both men fell. The bodies were kicked and prodded down an escarpment and dumped under the ice of the frozen Angara River. When the White Army learned about the executions, its remaining leadership decided to withdraw farther east. The Great Siberian Ice March then followed.

Grenades and flamethrowers were reportedly needed to fight stubborn NKVD holdouts intent on defending every inch of the complex.

jews.108.d:0 "Earlier today, German forces successfully occupied the city of Baku, a vital strategic objective in their war against the Soviet Union. \n\nLocated on the shores of the Caspian Sea, the city is the key to the Caucasus, and its many oil fields are sure to benefit the German war effort.\n\nIts capture puts Germany in a position to expand the war into the Middle East and possibly even India."
jews.109.t:0 "The Fall of Cairo"
jews.109.d:0 "Forces from the Deutsches Afrikakorps have fought their way to Cairo, the capital city of Egypt. \n\nAs Allied forces retreated further into the desert in disarray, German soldiers marching through Cairo were cheered as liberators by many citizens who had come to view the British as oppressors.\n\nThe fall of Cairo is a significant loss to the Allied war effort, and several experts have speculated that all of the Middle East now lies open to German conquest."
jews.110.t:0 "The Fall of Washington"
jews.110.d:0 "Fighting in the area of Washington D.C. came to an end today, when the last pockets of resistance in the city were eliminated by German forces advancing along the Potomac. \n\nA dense layer of smoke hangs over the city, and at least some of it reportedly comes from OSS agents who were burning sensitive documents up until the very last moment. A Waffen-SS detachment secured the White House after a brief firefight with members of the US Secret Service, but it is believed that the President was safely evacuated several days ago.\n\nThe fall of the American capital illustrates the terrible might of the German war machine."
jews.111.t:0 "The Fall of New York"
jews.111.d:0 "After hours of street warfare, much of it reportedly against armed irregulars, German spearheads have advanced into New York City and taken control of the city. \n\nImprovised anti-tank barriers placed along Fifth Avenue proved ineffective, and Panzergrenadiers fought their way through Manhattan, block by block.\n\nFires have been raging out of control in the eastern parts of the city for several days now, lighting up the skyline at night. \n\nThe Statue of Liberty was decapitated by a stray artillery round, though which side fired it remains a matter of dispute."
jews.112.t:0 "The Fall of Gibraltar"
jews.112.d:0 "After several conflicting reports, it has now been confirmed that Gibraltar has fallen to Germany. \n\nThis strategic port city guards the entrance to the Mediterranean, and it was widely regarded as impregnable before the war started. The British garrison retreated into the tunnels running underneath the Rock, but were eventually dislodged by flamethrowers and grenades. \n\nWith Gibraltar in German hands, there has been a dramatic shift in power in the Battle of the Mediterranean."
jews.113.d:0 "Jubilant Italian soldiers entered Cairo today, moments after the last British units retreated from the city. \n\nA victory parade was immediately organized, and Italian soldiers flocked to the Great Pyramids of Giza to have their pictures taken in front of the famous landmarks.\n\nWith Cairo under his control, Mussolini is now one step closer towards linking Italian East Africa with Italian Libya and forming a contiguous colony in Africa."
jews.113.b:0 "Another conquest for Italy!"
jews.114.d:0 "The last pockets of French resistance in Paris were mopped up today, and the city is now firmly under Italian control. \n\nIl Duce was hurriedly flown in to participate in the victory parade on the Champs-Élysées, riding in front of the marching troops on a white stallion. During the celebrations, he compared the current campaign in France with Caesar's conquest of Gaul, and promised that it was only the beginning of Italy's ascent to greatness.\n\nTime will tell if he is right."
jews.115.d:0 "Italian forces have successfully stormed London, and the il Tricolore has been hoisted over the Victoria Tower. Minor fighting continues in some parts of the city, and in an incident this morning several Bersaglieri were gunned down by snipers hidden at the top of Big Ben.\n\nAfter three failed attempts to dislodge them, the entire clock tower was brought down by demolition charges in what Italian officials are describing as a 'regrettable overreaction' by the local commander."
jews.116.d:0 "Italy appears to be in control of Gibraltar, after what has been reported as heavy fighting around the Rock and the harbor. Occasional explosions can still be heard from the military tunnels running deep under the Rock, but Italian officials claim an end to all organized resistance.\n\nWith this vital gateway to the Mediterranean under Italian control, British naval forces will be hard-pressed to challenge the Regia Marina in the region."
jews.117.t:0 "The Fall of Singapore"
jews.117.d:0 "Singapore, the 'Gibraltar of the East,' has been seized by Imperial Japanese forces despite having been considered an impregnable fortress by its former British owners.\n\nThe Japanese Military Administration of Singapore has chosen the Fullerton Building as its headquarters, and the city has been renamed Syonanto, which roughly translates to 'Southern Island gained in the age of Showa.' The Kempeitai can be seen patrolling the streets en masse to hammer in the message that the Japanese are there to stay."
jews.117.b:0 "For the Emperor!"
jews.118.t:0 "The Fall of Pearl Harbor"
jews.118.d:0 "Japanese forces have stormed and taken Honolulu, the largest city on the Hawaiian island of O'ahu. The naval base at Pearl Harbor, former headquarters of the US Pacific Fleet, has also fallen.\n\nAccording to witnesses, beleaguered American sailors and Marines retreated to Ford Island, where they continued to offer stubborn resistance until they were subjected to an intense artillery and aerial bombardment. With this island under its control, the long reach of the Imperial Japanese Navy has become greater still."
jews.119.t:0 "The Fall of New South Wales"
jews.119.d:0 "Further expanding on its conquests in the south, the empire of Japan has seized Sydney and the Australian capital Canberra. Local defenders were forced to retreat across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to new positions on Observatory Hill, but attempts to demolish the bridge were thwarted by advancing Japanese forces, who then pushed on to take Canberra.\n\nThe Japanese war flag can now be seen hanging from the Parliament House in Canberra, which serves as the headquarters of the area's new military administration, and the Kempeitai military police are maintaining a watchful eye on the streets."
jews.120.t:0 "The Fall of Los Angeles"
jews.120.d:0 "After establishing a foothold on the American mainland, Japanese forces have converged on Los Angeles and routed the city's defenders. A long procession of Imperial troops marched down Central Avenue this afternoon while Japanese newsreel photographers filmed the event.\n\nBefore American forces retreated, fighting was reportedly fierce in several areas of the city. Hollywood suffered particularly heavy damage, and many Japanese officers have had their pictures taken in front of the perforated and crumbling Hollywood Sign."
jews.121.t:0 "The Fall of Nanjing"
jews.121.d:0 "The capital of the Republic of China, Nanjing, has been occupied by forces from the Empire of Japan. Despite fierce resistance from the walled city's Chinese defenders, Japanese troops managed to capture Zhongshan Gate and fought their way into the city.\n\nSporadic gunfire can still be heard and several fires are raging in different parts of the city, but most surviving Chinese forces have either withdrawn or been captured. Along with the capture of Shanghai, this is a significant victory for Japan in their war against China."
jews.122.t:0 "The Fall of Vladivostok"
jews.122.d:0 "Vladivostok, the largest city in the Russian Far East and home of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, has been stormed by Japanese troops. Its strategic position at the far end of the Trans-Siberian Railway makes its loss all the more detrimental to the Soviet war effort in Asia.\n\nMany of the city's inhabitants still remember the Japanese occupation that lasted for several years during the Russian Civil War. This time, some fear they may never leave."
jews.123.t:0 "The Fall of Hong Kong"
jews.123.d:0 "Troops from the Empire of Japan have captured the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong after breaking through the Gin Drinkers Line and landing on Hong Kong Island itself. The situation soon became untenable for the defenders, and the Governor surrendered in person at the Peninsula Hong Kong hotel where the Japanese had established their headquarters.\n\nAfter a brief ceremony, a new Japanese governor was installed who announced a 'New Hong Kong' to the world, 'free of Western colonialism.'"
jews.124.t:0 "The Fall of Manila"
jews.124.d:0 "Manila, capital of the Philippines, has fallen to the Japanese after the withdrawal of its American and Filipino defenders. The entrance to the strategically vital Manila Bay remained contested for some time after the city's fall due to the heavy concentration of American coastal artillery on Corregidor Island, but the guns eventually fell silent after a concerted Japanese attack.\n\nWith Manila under Japanese control, the rest of the Philippines are expected to follow shortly after. This is a stinging defeat for American forces in Asia and the Pacific."
jews.125.t:0 "The Fall of Calcutta"
jews.125.d:0 "After a period of heavy bombardment, it has now been confirmed that the city of Calcutta in India has fallen to advancing Japanese forces. Even while sporadic fighting was still occurring in the outskirts of the city, a victory parade was quickly organized on Chowringhee avenue.\n\nMembers of the Indian National Army, a military outfit organized by the Japanese and dedicated to the liberation of India from Britain, took part in the parade and drew wild cheers from the crowds. With the fall of Calcutta, many predict that all of British India will soon follow."
jews.126.t:0 "The Fall of New Delhi"
jews.126.d:0 "Japanese offensives continue in India, and the fall of New Delhi recently took place. As the capital of British India, this city is of immense strategic importance and its loss may prove to be a decisive factor in the ongoing Indian campaign.\n\nThe Viceroy himself was reportedly captured by Japanese forward units while he was supervising the transfer of his belongings from the Viceroy's House to a truck caravan, but this has not yet been confirmed."
jews.127.t:0 "The Fall of the Panama Canal"
jews.127.d:0 "In what must be considered a monumental blow to the American war effort, Japanese forces have landed in Panama and taken control of the canal after forcing the surrender of its garrison. Several parties of American and Panamanian soldiers reportedly escaped into the nearby jungle to wage guerrilla warfare, but it is not believed that they can significantly threaten the Japanese presence.\n\nWith the fall of the canal, American naval forces now have to round South America to reach the US West Coast, giving the Imperial Japanese Navy a significant strategic advantage."
jews.128.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
jews.128.d:0 "The capture of the German capital has been confirmed by officials in Washington, after US forces fought their way into Berlin from several directions. Fighting in the city was described as intense, with the Moltke Bridge being demolished by desperate German pioneers to halt the American advance.\n\nOther bridges over the Spree were eventually secured, and GIs successfully stormed the Kroll Opera House and the Reichstag despite fierce German resistance. The Stars and Stripes now flutters in the wind above the Reichstag, and fighting in the city has ceased. The Battle of Berlin is over."
jews.128.b:0 "A textbook operation!"
jews.129.d:0 "British forces have advanced into Berlin, and the War Cabinet has announced the successful capture of the German capital after a pitched battle. Striking at dawn, British commandos seized the Tempelhof Airport while armored columns advanced along the Frankfurter Allee.\n\nWith the Reich Chancellery under British control, fighting in the city has largely ended. The current status of the German government remains unclear, but it is believed that at least some elements of it escaped the city before its fall."
jews.129.b:0 "Smashing good job, lads!"
jews.130.d:0 "French forces have successfully stormed the German capital, which fell after a series of pitched battles within the city limits. A large group of Waffen-SS soldiers barricaded themselves in the Olympiastadion, which eventually fell after a determined attack by Foreign Legionnaires supported by artillery.\n\nThe French tricolor can now be seen flying over the Reich Chancellery, and although sporadic fighting is still being reported from some suburbs, most of Berlin is believed to have been cleared of organized resistance."
jews.130.b:0 "Vive la France!"
jews.131.d:0 "Desperate fighting has been reported from Berlin, the capital of Germany, but it is now believed that the city is completely in Polish hands. After advancing along the Frankfurter Allee, the Poles reached the Alexanderplatz which was the scene of a pitched battle.\n\nElsewhere in the city, the Brandenburg Gate collapsed, supposedly after being rammed by a Polish tank, and the Kroll Opera House was leveled by an artillery barrage after its stubborn SS defenders refused to surrender. The red and white of the Polish flag now flies above the Reichstag, and the last pockets of resistance have been dealt with."
jews.131.b:0 "The Polish juggernaut cannot be stopped."
jews.132.t:0 "The Fall of Rome"
jews.132.d:0 "Allied forces recently entered Rome after the surrender of its garrison, and the city is now under military occupation. Most historical landmarks remain intact, having weathered yet another battle for control over the city. For now at least, Allied troops have stayed outside Vatican City at the request of the Holy See.\n\nThe fall of Rome is an important milestone in the Italian campaign, and some are wondering if this means an end of the organized resistance to the advancing Allied armies on the peninsula."
jews.132.b:0 "A great victory!"
jews.133.d:0 "Forces from France recently entered Rome after the city's remaining Italian garrison melted away into the surrounding countryside. The French troops moved quickly to occupy all significant government buildings, and a 'triumph' was held along the Via del Corso by a long procession of marching soldiers and armored vehicles.\n\nWith the fall of Rome, the ability of Italy to continue the war is put into question. Outside observers expect that the Italian government, who fled the city just before its fall, will soon begin surrender negotiations."
jews.134.t:0 "The Liberation of Paris"
jews.134.d:0 "It has now been confirmed that Paris, the capital of France, has been liberated from German occupation. Allied forces have entered the city, and the remaining German garrison has surrendered. Parisians could be seen cheering their liberators as they marched down the Champs Élysées, even while there were rumors of German sniper fire in some parts of the city.\n\nIt was feared that the Germans would employ a strategy of scorched earth and leave Paris a burning ruin, but the city's landmarks appear to have been spared. Indeed, the French tricolor can even now be seen flying from the Eiffel Tower."
jews.135.t:0 "The Fall of Tokyo"
jews.135.d:0 "American forces have entered Tokyo, and the US War Department recently announced an end to major combat operations in the city. Fighting was reported as heavy, particularly in the vicinity of the Imperial Palace which was defended by fanatical members of the Imperial Guard, even though the Emperor is believed to have left the city before the American assault began.\n\nWith the fall of Tokyo, experts predict that organized resistance on the rest of the Japanese Home Islands will soon crumble. Peace negotiations are expected to begin shortly, unless Japanese hardliners convince the Emperor to continue the fight to the death."
jews.136.d:0 "After a series of pitched battles, Allied forces have occupied Moscow, capital of the Soviet Union. The city has suffered extensive damage, and fires are still raging on both sides of the Moskva river. Despite heavy bombing the Kremlin is reasonably intact, and it has been chosen as the location for the headquarters of the Allied Occupation Administration.\n\nWith the loss of Moscow, the Soviet war effort has suffered an enormous blow. Although most of the government is believed to have evacuated the city well in advance of its fall, military experts claim that a complete Soviet collapse may not be far away."
jews.137.t:0 "The Liberation of London"
jews.137.d:0 "Fighting has ended in London, with the last pockets of German resistance having been dealt with. As soon as the all-clear was given, jubilant crowds rushed onto the streets to celebrate their American liberators, while church bells could be heard ringing throughout the city.\n\nLiberation fever seems to be embracing Britain, as it now finally appears likely that the German occupation is coming to an end. Spontaneous uprisings have been reported in areas still under German control, though these incidents have been dealt with harshly. Has freedom at last returned to the United Kingdom?"
jews.138.d:0 "Unlike 1920, there was no 'Miracle at the Vistula' when Soviet armies recently approached Warsaw. Polish resistance in the city has largely collapsed, and the Soviet flag can be seen raised over most government buildings.\n\nAre we witnessing the end of the Polish nation, or will their forces somehow manage to rebound and retake their capital? Most experts consider this scenario unlikely."
jews.138.b:0 "Onwards, comrades!"
jews.139.t:0 "The Liberation of Warsaw"
jews.139.d:0 "The devastated city of Warsaw has fallen to advancing Soviet armies, after the last German defenders retreated from its burning suburbs. Much of the city lies in ruins after previous battles, and local resistance members hurriedly emerged from the rubble to greet their liberators.\n\nWith Warsaw under Soviet control, the strategic situation for Germany in Eastern Europe may soon deteriorate further. Experts are doubtful that they will be able to mount a counterattack to retake the city, but the harried local population does not seem quite as convinced."

As Italian forces fell back, Russian troops fanned out into the city and dealt with the few remaining pockets of resistance. Most historical landmarks appear to have suffered little damage, although there are conflicting reports that the Pantheon was raked by machine gun fire.\n\nSo far the Soviets appear to be respecting the neutrality of the Holy See, but their forces have positioned themselves in a ring around Vatican City - a gesture that must surely make His Holiness nervous."

French Communists supposedly aided the Soviets when they entered the city, taking part in attacks against retreating elements of the armée de terre.\n\nLeaflets have been distributed throughout the city, informing Parisians that they have been 'liberated from the Bourgeoisie oppression' and that the Paris Commune has finally been resurrected."

Many of the city's defenders reportedly drowned in the Seine after a heavy Soviet artillery barrage demolished several of the bridges crossing the river.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower was toppled after a massive explosion at its base, although it remains unclear which side was responsible. Soviet forces are now holding a victory parade on the Champs-Élysées while weary Parisians look on, wondering if they have only traded one occupier for another."

jews.145.d:0 "Fires continue to rage in central London, but it is believed that most of the city's German occupiers have either fallen in battle or been captured by the advancing Soviet forces. Crowds have emerged on the streets to cheer the Russians on as they move to deal with the last stubborn holdouts.\n\nCollaborators have been dealt with harshly, and the Soviets have organized an interim council to administrate the liberated city until further notice. Critics have observed that the members of this council all appear to have been drawn from the Communist Party of Great Britain."

jews.146.d:0 "Soviet forces have converged on Tokyo, and heavy fighting has been reported throughout the city. Most of the city is under Soviet control now, with the exception of the eastern suburbs where massive fires are still raging.\n\nWhen the fighting shifted towards the Imperial Palace, members of the Imperial Guard reportedly launched bayonet charges against the approaching Soviet troops. The palace was eventually stormed by a detachment of VDV paratroopers, who had to fight their way through the compound room by room. No prisoners were taken, but it is believed that the Emperor was safely evacuated before the city fell."
jews.147.d:0 "Leningrad, the former capital of the Russian Empire, has been occupied by Finnish forces. With a population of over three million, the city has nearly as many inhabitants as all of Finland, but this fact has evidently not deterred the Finnish attackers.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether the city should be integrated into Greater Finland, since Ingrian Finns make up a considerable minority in the regions outside the city. This, of course, assumes that the Red Army is unable to retake the city in a counteroffensive."
jews.148.d:0 "News coming in from Tokyo recently confirmed that the city has fallen to Chinese forces. Much of it lies in ruins, including the Imperial Palace which now serves as the headquarters of the Chinese military administration.\n\nForeign reporters witnessed a massive victory parade that featured a seemingly endless procession of Chinese soldiers marching through the city. Japanese citizens lining the streets watched the parading troops in silence."

News coming in from the territory report that most of the garrison has surrendered, although a few stubborn holdouts have retreated to tunnels running under the Rock.\n\nAt a press conference in Madrid, representatives of the government stated that Gibraltar is henceforth to be considered Spanish territory 'in perpetuity.'
